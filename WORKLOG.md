# Development Worklog for CogX & Cognition-CLI

This file serves as an audit trail for the development of this project, aligning with the CogX principle of maintaining a verifiable history.

## High-Level Documentation Plan (The "Dogfooding" Strategy)

**Objective:** The ultimate goal is for `cognition-cli` to generate its own documentation by analyzing its own source code.

### Phase A: Manual Ground Truth Creation (Current Phase)

1. **Action:** Manually set up a documentation site using VitePress.
2. **Action:** Write the initial, high-quality documentation for the project, covering architecture, concepts, and commands.
3. **Purpose:** This provides immediate, necessary documentation for the project while simultaneously creating the "verifiable target" or "ground truth" for the future AI-driven process.

### Phase B: AI-Driven Dogfooding (Future Phase)

1. **Action:** Create a new `cognition-cli docs:generate` command.
2. **Mechanism:** This command will use a `technical_writer` persona to query its own PGC.
3. **Process:** It will execute a `Transform` to generate VitePress-compatible Markdown files from the knowledge contained within the PGC.
4. **Verification:** An `Oracle` will compare the AI-generated docs against the manually-written "ground truth" docs from Phase A to produce a Fidelity Factor (Phi).
5. **Goal:** Achieve a Phi score > 0.95, proving the system can document itself to a human-quality standard.

## Action Log

- **2025-10-21:** Comprehensive Refactoring and Bug Fixes for Pattern Management and Lineage Generation.
  - **Functionality:**
    - **Pattern Retrieval & Analysis:** Corrected logic in `StructuralPatternsManager` and `LineagePatternsManager` for `findSimilarPatterns` and `getVectorForSymbol` to accurately retrieve patterns from the manifest using direct symbol lookup instead of an incorrect `endsWith` filter. This resolves issues where `find-similar` and `compare` commands failed to locate patterns.
    - **Pattern Persistence:** Modified `LanceVectorStore` to conditionally create LanceDB tables only if they don't exist, preventing accidental deletion of previously generated patterns upon initialization. The `forceCreateTable` method was removed. This ensures that `patterns analyze` now correctly displays architectural pattern distributions.
    - **Lineage Generation Efficiency:** Refactored `PGCManager.getLineageForStructuralPatterns` to pre-populate a `symbolToStructuralDataMap` with initial structural data and overlay patterns, eliminating redundant calls to `_findOverlaySymbolsInPath`. Unused `sourceHash` parameter was removed, and `structural_hash` assignment for dummy `bestResult` was corrected to compute the hash of the `structuralData` object.
    - **Error Handling:** Added a check in `PGCManager.getLineageForStructuralPatterns` to ensure `transformHash` is not empty before accessing its elements, resolving a `TypeError` in `TransformLog.getTransformData`.
    - **Overlay Orchestration Enhancements:** Updated `OverlayOrchestrator` to include `StructuralMiner`, `OverlayOracle`, and `GenesisOracle` for more robust pattern generation and verification. Implemented spinner for better UX, integrated `discoverFiles` and `runPGCMaintenance`, and added logic to handle `PartiallyProcessed` status for workbench-dependent extractions. The `generateManifest` method was updated to accept `SourceFile[]`.
    - **Schema & Configuration:** Added `PartiallyProcessed` status to `IndexDataSchema` and enabled `sourceMap` in `tsconfig.json`.
  - **User Impact:** These changes significantly improve the reliability and functionality of the `cognition-cli` pattern management commands (`analyze`, `find-similar`, `compare`), ensuring accurate pattern retrieval, persistence, and analysis. The lineage generation process is now more efficient and robust, with better error handling and user feedback.
- **2025-10-20:** Implemented manifest-driven type lineage generation.
- **2025-10-20:** Refactored vector store to support multiple schemas.
- **2025-10-20:** Fixed `patterns find-similar` command path resolution.
  - **Functionality:** Corrected `PGCManager` initialization in `src/cognition-cli/src/commands/patterns.ts` to use `process.cwd()`, ensuring `.open_cognition` is located correctly when the command is run from the `cognition-cli` directory. Also ensured `StructuralPatternsManager` correctly resolves overlay keys from the manifest and added missing `path` import.
  - **User Impact:** The `patterns find-similar` command now functions reliably from the `cognition-cli` directory, providing accurate structural pattern search results.
- **2025-10-20:** Implemented per-symbol structural_patterns overlay, updated documentation, and restored `findPrimarySymbol` method.
- **2025-10-20:** Added `EMBED_PROMPT_NAME` constant and integrated it into the `embed` function.
  - **Functionality:** Defined `EMBED_PROMPT_NAME` in `config.ts` and used it as `prompt_name` in the `formData` for the `embed` function in `workbench-client.ts`.
  - **User Impact:** Ensures consistent and correct prompt naming for embedding requests.
- **2025-10-19:** Implement demo-ready enhancements for `patterns` commands:
  - **Functionality:**
    - Enhanced `patterns:find-similar` with rich formatting using `chalk` and added a `--json` option for raw output.
    - Introduced `patterns:analyze` command to display architectural role distribution.
    - Introduced `patterns:compare` command to visualize dependency lineage differences between two symbols.
  - **User Impact:** Provides a more visually appealing and informative CLI experience, making the `cognition-cli` demo-ready with advanced pattern analysis and comparison capabilities.
- **2025-10-19:** Documented `patterns find-similar` command:
  - **Functionality:** Updated `src/cognition-cli/docs/03_Commands.md` and `src/cognition-cli/README.md` to include documentation for the newly added `patterns find-similar` command, detailing its usage and functionality.
  - **User Impact:** Ensures users are aware of and can effectively utilize the new structural pattern similarity search feature.
- **2025-10-19:** Add `patterns find-similar` command for structural pattern similarity search:
  - **Functionality:** Implemented a new CLI command `cognition-cli patterns find-similar <symbol> --top-k <number>` that allows users to find code components structurally similar to a given symbol. This command leverages the `StructuralPatternsManager` and `LanceVectorStore` to perform vector-based similarity searches.
  - **User Impact:** Provides a powerful new capability for code exploration, refactoring, and identifying architectural patterns, enhancing code understanding and maintainability.
- **2025-10-19:** Optimize Index.search for small datasets:
  - **Functionality:** Modified the `Index.search` method to dynamically switch between single-threaded and multi-threaded search based on the number of files. For datasets smaller than `WORKER_THRESHOLD` (100 files), it now performs a single-threaded search to avoid the overhead of worker creation and inter-process communication.
  - **User Impact:** Significantly improves search performance for smaller projects by reducing unnecessary worker overhead, leading to faster response times.  
- **2025-10-19:** Add Structural Pattern Recognition and Similarity Search:
  - **Functionality:** The `cognition-cli` now possesses the core intelligence to automatically extract, store, and analyze structural patterns within codebases. This enables the identification of recurring architectural elements and the ability to find structurally similar code components.
  - **Key Components:**
    - **`OverlayOrchestrator`:** Manages the end-to-end process of generating and updating structural patterns. It iterates through source files, extracts structural data, and orchestrates the pattern generation workflow.
    - **`StructuralPatternsManager`:** Responsible for generating unique "structural signatures" and inferring "architectural roles" (e.g., 'orchestrator', 'data_access', 'service') for code components. It also facilitates similarity searches.
    - **`LanceVectorStore`:** A new local vector database integrated to efficiently store and query vector embeddings of these structural patterns.
    - **`WorkbenchClient Enhancements`:** Extended to interact with an external Workbench service for generating high-dimensional embeddings of structural signatures, including robust client-side rate limiting.
  - **User Impact:** This lays the foundation for future
    - Perform similarity searches to discover structurally analogous code components, aiding in code understanding, refactoring, and architectural consistency.
