### Practical Example: Calculating Phi

Let's imagine our **Goal (G)** is to create a summary of a source code file, `auth.py`.

**1. Goal & Weights:**
In our `Goal` definition, we set the weights for the calculation. For this task, we decide factual correctness (Grounding) is most important.

- Weight for Tool Oracle (wT): **0.2**
- Weight for Grounding Oracle (wG): **0.5**
- Weight for Goal-Specific Oracle (wS): **0.3**

**2. Oracle Validation:**
The LLM generates a summary, and the Oracles validate it, producing their scores (phi):

- **Tool Oracle (OT):** The output is valid JSON. -> **Score (phiT): 1.0**
- **Grounding Oracle (OG):** The summary is 85% factually correct compared to the source code. -> **Score (phiG): 0.85**
- **Goal-Specific Oracle (OS):** The summary met 1 of 2 other criteria (e.g., mentioned a library, but was over the word count). -> **Score (phiS): 0.5**

**3. Final Calculation:**
We apply the formula: Phi = (wT _ phiT) + (wG _ phiG) + wS \* phiS

- Phi = (0.2 _ 1.0) + (0.5 _ 0.85) + (0.3 \* 0.5)
- Phi = 0.2 + 0.425 + 0.15
- Phi = 0.775

The final Fidelity Factor for the transformation is **0.775**.
