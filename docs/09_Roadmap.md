# **Roadmap: From Blueprint to Living System**

This blueprint presents a complete, formal architecture for a verifiable, agentic AI. The journey from this theoretical design to a functioning, intelligent system is a significant engineering endeavor. This roadmap outlines a pragmatic, phased approach to development, prioritizing the construction of a solid foundation before building the more complex layers of semantic understanding and agentic behavior.

The core principle of this roadmap is **progressive enrichment**: we first build the immutable, verifiable skeleton of the knowledge base, then add the flesh of semantic understanding, and finally breathe life into it with a dynamic, learning mind.

## **Phase I: The Genesis Engine - Building the Verifiable Skeleton**

The objective of this foundational phase is to solve the first and most critical problem: transforming a raw, unstructured codebase into the structural, verifiable backbone of the Grounded Context Pool (PGC). This phase focuses on mining objective facts, deliberately treating the nuanced semantic content of code as "noise" to be addressed later.

**Key Milestones:**

1. **Establish the Backend Infrastructure:**
    * Implement the core file system structure of the PGC. This involves creating the logic to manage the four pillars: the content-addressable `objects/` store, the immutable `transforms/` log, the navigable `index/`, and the performance-critical `reverse_deps/` index. This is the physical "brain case" of the system.

2. **Develop the Structural Mining Pipeline:**
    * This is the core of the Genesis Engine. The goal is to parse the entire source repository (Draw) and extract only the "Class 1" structural data: imports, class definitions, function signatures, data types, and file dependencies. This will be a multi-layered process, embracing a heterogeneous model approach:
        * **Layer 1 (Deterministic Parsing):** For supported languages, create `Transform` agents that use traditional Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsers. This provides a high-speed, 100% accurate baseline for structural facts. This is the ultimate "ground truth."
        * **Layer 2 (Specialized SLM):** Fine-tune a Small Language Model (SLM) specifically for the task of "Code Structure Extraction." This model's `Goal` is not to understand the code, but to quickly and scalably identify and output its structural components in a standardized format (e.g., JSON). This provides flexibility across multiple languages and resilience to minor syntax variations.
        * **Layer 3 (Generalist LLM as Supervisor):** The role of the generalist LLM is not to perform the line-by-line parsing. Its role is strategic: to generate and refine the AST parsing scripts (Layer 1) and to supervise the fine-tuning of the specialized SLM (Layer 2). It also serves as an escalation point for files that the other layers fail to process.

3. **Implement the Structural Oracle (`OStructure`):**
    * Develop the first and most fundamental oracle. `OStructure`'s job is to verify the output of the mining pipeline. It checks for the integrity of the PGC's structure, ensures that all dependencies are correctly logged in the `reverse_deps` index, and validates that the graph is coherent.

**Outcome of Phase I:** A PGC containing a complete, verifiable, but largely *un-interpreted* structural map of the project. The system knows *what* exists and *how* it is connected, but not yet *why* or *how* it works. This is the stable scaffold upon which all future intelligence will be built.

## **Phase II: The Semantic Core - Adding Flesh to the Bones**

With the verifiable skeleton in place, this phase focuses on enriching the PGC with deep semantic understanding. This is where the powerful reasoning capabilities of generalist LLMs are brought to bear, guided by the structure created in Phase I.

**Key Milestones:**

1. **Implement the Core `Goal -> Transform -> Oracle` Loop:** Build the central processing logic within the Orchestrator (`cognition-cli`) that can execute a task defined by a `Goal`, apply a `Transform` using an LLM agent, and validate the result with an `Oracle`.
2. **Develop the Genesis Algorithms:** Implement the `Bottom-Up` and `Sideways Aggregation` algorithms described in the blueprint. These will use the structural data from Phase I as the grounded input to generate high-quality summaries, identify logical components, and create a rich, multi-layered understanding of the project's architecture and purpose.
3. **Introduce Advanced Oracles (`OGrounding`, `OGoal`):** Develop the more sophisticated oracles required for semantic work. `OGrounding` will fact-check the generated summaries against the source code, while `OGoal` will assess whether the output meets the specific criteria defined in its `Goal`.

**Outcome of Phase II:** A PGC that is not just structurally sound, but semantically rich. The system now possesses a deep and auditable *understanding* of the project.

## **Phase III: The Agentic Mind - Achieving Dynamic Operation & Learning**

This final phase makes the knowledge base "live." It focuses on building the interfaces, dynamic functions, and learning mechanisms that allow the system to interact with a human collaborator, adapt to change, and evolve over time.

**Key Milestones:**

1. **Build the `cognition-cli` and `cognition-script` Meta-Interpreter:** Develop the user-facing command-line interface and the "living language" engine that can interpret orchestration logic from within the knowledge base itself.
2. **Implement the Core Dynamic Functions (`Update Function` & `Context Sampling Function`):** Build the reactive heart of the system. The `Update Function` (U) will use the `reverse_deps` index to efficiently propagate changes, while the `Context Sampling Function` (Sigma) will compose optimal contexts for answering user queries.
3. **Activate the Learning Loop:** Implement the `Agentic Quality Score` (AQS) as a key performance metric. Create the "Wisdom Distiller" agent, which analyzes the `Operations Log` of successful tasks to generate `Cognitive Micro-Tuning Payloads` (CoMPs).
4. **Enable the Ecosystem:** Develop the protocols for packaging the PGC into distributable `.cogx` files and for sharing `CoMP`s on the "Semantic Echo Network." This is the final step that turns an isolated agent into a node in a collaborative, evolving "superorganism."

**Outcome of Phase III:** A fully operational, interactive, and learning CogX system that fulfills the complete vision of the blueprint.
