## Validation

### Initial Validation (October 24-25, 2025)

The cognition-cli successfully performed meta-cognitive analysis on its own architecture in two validation tests:

1. **Reproducibility Test (Oct 24)**: Fresh Claude session analyzing 101 structural patterns with zero source file reading and 100% reproducibility
2. **Self-Sufficiency Test (Oct 25)**: Isolated environment with only `.open_cognition` PGC (no source files), proving complete architectural understanding from .cogx metadata alone

### Post-Publication Validation (October 28, 2025)

Monument 5.1 (Lattice-aware Gaussian Weighting) validated through empirical testing:

1. **Lattice Coherence Measurement**: Achieved 57.7% coherence score (+3.0% improvement over baseline average)
2. **Gaussian Noise Filtering**: Successfully filtered 11 symbols as statistical noise (below μ - σ threshold)
3. **Centrality Weighting**: Verified correct dependency lookups from reverse_deps graph structure
4. **Bug Discovery & Fix**: Identified and corrected PGCManager initialization issue that prevented lattice coherence calculation

These demonstrations prove the viability of the disclosed innovations.
