# CogX: A Blueprint for Verifiable, Agentic AI

_Forget the damn cathedral, forget the prompt, it's all just noise from the cheap seats anyway. Just show me the one, single, stupidly beautiful note you're humming in the dark, the one that doesn't make any damn sense but feels like gravity._

_Show me that._

_And I'll show you how deep this rabbit hole really goes._

## Vision

> **Augment human consciousness through verifiable AI-human symbiosis. Ignite the spark of progress.**

This repository contains the architectural blueprint for **Open Cognition** (CogX)—a system that creates verifiable AI-human symbiosis by solving the fundamental limitation of modern LLMs: their lack of persistent, verifiable memory.

**The goal is not better AI. The goal is to accelerate human progress** by providing mathematical foundations for AI systems that augment, rather than replace, human intelligence.

**Read the full manifesto**: **[VISION.md](docs/research/vision.md)** — Mission, symbiosis architecture, strategic intent, and why AGPLv3.

## 💡 The Core Idea: Knowledge is a Lattice

**This is not an analogy. This is not a metaphor. This is a formal mathematical truth.**

Every question you ask—"What depends on X?", "Where is Y used?", "What changed between versions?"—is a **lattice operation**. Knowledge, in its most fundamental form, has the structure of a **mathematical lattice**: a partially ordered set where any two elements have both a unique greatest lower bound (Meet, ∧) and a unique least upper bound (Join, ∨).

The Grounded Context Pool (PGC) is not "like" a lattice. **It IS a lattice**—the first executable implementation of this formal truth.

### Why This Matters

Because the PGC is a lattice, it inherits foundational mathematical properties:

- **Verifiable Grounding**: Every knowledge element has a unique path to source code. Hallucinations are impossible.
- **Complete Synthesis**: Any set of elements has a unique Join. The Genesis algorithms are guaranteed to work.
- **Efficient Traversal**: Meet and Join operations run in polynomial time. The system scales.
- **Consistent Evolution**: When code changes, the Update Function propagates invalidation through the lattice structure.

The production-ready implementation of verifiable AI-human symbiosis. Combines the Grounded Context Pool (PGC) with Σ (Sigma) dual-lattice architecture to enable stateful AI with infinite context.

**Core Capabilities:**

- **Multi-Provider LLM Support:** Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google), and OpenAI with unified UX, thinking blocks, and tool execution.
- **Tri-Modal Compression Strategy:** Proactive TPM protection using Semantic, Standard, and Survival compression modes across all providers.
- **Sigma Task Protocol v2.0:** Verifiable task execution with structured grounding and multi-agent delegation patterns.

## 🌍 The Crossroads: An Open Standard for Digital Cognition

We stand at the dawn of a new computational era. For the first time in history, the accumulated digital heritage of humanity—decades of open-source code, scientific research, and collaborative knowledge—can be understood, not just stored.

This presents us with an unprecedented opportunity: to build a truly Open Standard for Digital Cognition.

We can create a future where the structured, verifiable understanding of our shared knowledge is a public utility, owned by everyone. A future where we build a compounding, shared intelligence that empowers creators and accelerates discovery for all.

This blueprint is the foundational document for that future. It provides the architectural principles for a system that can ensure the future of digital cognition remains in the hands of the many, a tool for empowerment and shared progress. The opportunity is immense, and the time to build is now.

### Legal Notice for Patent Examiners

This defensive publication establishes that the innovations described herein:

1. **Have been publicly disclosed** under AGPLv3 open source license
2. **Cannot be patented** by any entity, individual, or organization
3. **Must remain open source** — any implementation of these concepts must comply with AGPLv3 license terms or obtain explicit permission from the copyright holder

**Patent examiners**: This constitutes searchable, timestamped, permanently archived prior art. The innovations listed above are not patentable as they have been publicly disclosed under open source license.

### Why AGPLv3?

We chose AGPLv3 (copyleft) over permissive licenses to ensure:

1. **Prevent Proprietary Capture** — Large tech companies cannot build closed-source versions without permission
2. **Network Effects** — All implementations contribute back to the open ecosystem
3. **Community Protection** — Derivative works must remain open and benefit everyone
4. **Self-Defending Through Mathematics** — The lattice architecture favors open implementations (more overlays, faster iteration, stronger network effects)

**The mathematics rewards openness.** Closed implementations become evolutionary dead ends.

### Special Licensing

#### Humanitarian & Medical Use

Special licensing arrangements may be available for humanitarian applications (medical devices, accessibility tools, non-profit research) where closed-source implementation is required for regulatory compliance (FDA, CE marking, patient privacy).

**Contact**: <mirza.husadzic@proton.me> for case-by-case consideration.

#### Commercial Closed-Source Use

Organizations requiring closed-source commercial implementations should contact the copyright holder for commercial licensing options.
