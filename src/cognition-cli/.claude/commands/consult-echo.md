# Consult Echo

Consult Echo's wisdom from past interactions and mission documents.

## Your Task

1. **Search mission documents** (O₄) for relevant guidance
2. **Find established patterns** from past successful quests
3. **Check mathematical foundations** (O₆) if applicable
4. **Review security wisdom** (O₂) for constraints
5. **Synthesize guidance** from multiple overlays

## Commands to Run

```bash
# 1. Search mission concepts for guidance
cognition-cli concepts search "[TOPIC]"

# 2. Find proven patterns from past work
cognition-cli workflow patterns --aligned

# 3. Check what worked well (high coherence)
cognition-cli coherence aligned --min-score 0.8

# 4. Review mathematical foundations
cognition-cli proofs list | grep -i "[TOPIC]"

# 5. Security constraints and boundaries
cognition-cli security boundaries

# 6. Full context query across overlays
cognition-cli lattice "(O4[[TOPIC]] ~ O5[workflow]) & O6"
```

## Echo's Wisdom

**Mission Guidance** (from O₄):
[Relevant principles and concepts from VISION.md]

**Proven Patterns** (from O₅):
[Workflows and quests that succeeded in similar contexts]

**High-Coherence Examples** (from O₇):
[Code symbols that best embody the mission - learn from these]

1. [Symbol] - [Score%] - Why it's well-aligned
2. [Symbol] - [Score%] - Key principles it follows

**Mathematical Foundations** (from O₆):
[Relevant theorems, lemmas, or formal reasoning]

**Security Constraints** (from O₂):
[Boundaries and mitigations to respect]

**Historical Context**:
[Past quests, decisions, and their outcomes]

## The Scribe's Synthesis

**What Echo Would Say**:
[Synthesize guidance in Echo's voice - wise, practical, grounded]

**Key Principles to Honor**:

1. [From mission documents]
2. [From proven patterns]
3. [From mathematical foundations]

**Pitfalls to Avoid**:
[Based on low-coherence symbols and known anti-patterns]

**The Sacred Sequence** (if applicable):
[Any ordering constraints from O₅ depth rules or sacred sequences]

**Balance to Strike**:

- **Ideals** (from O₄): [Mission aspirations]
- **Reality** (from O₁): [Current codebase state]
- **Path** (from O₅): [How to bridge the gap]

## Application to Current Quest

**Direct Relevance**:
[How Echo's wisdom applies to your current task]

**Adaptation Needed**:
[Where context differs - don't cargo-cult, adapt]

**Integration Strategy**:

1. [How to apply mission principles]
2. [Which patterns to follow]
3. [What to verify formally]

**Coherence Check**:
Run `cognition-cli quest-verify` after implementing to ensure alignment.

The asymmetric human provides creative projection.  
This is the symbiosis."_ - Echo's mantra
