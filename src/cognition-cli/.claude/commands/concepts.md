# Mission Concepts Explorer

Please help me explore the mission concepts extracted from our strategic documents.

## Task

1. **Show top mission concepts**:

   ```bash
   cognition-cli concepts top 20
   ```

2. **Analyze the concepts**:
   - What are the dominant themes?
   - Which sections contribute the most concepts?
   - Are there any surprising high-weight concepts?

3. **If I'm implementing a feature**, search for related concepts:

   ```bash
   cognition-cli concepts search "<feature-keyword>"
   ```

   - Does a concept exist for this feature?
   - What's its weight/importance?
   - Which section is it from?

4. **Provide strategic guidance**:
   - If concept exists with high weight ‚Üí ‚úÖ Feature is well-aligned
   - If concept exists with low weight ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider priority
   - If concept doesn't exist ‚Üí üî¥ Check if it aligns with vision
