  DUAL-USE TECHNOLOGY MANDATE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Version: 1.0
Status: CRITICAL - MUST READ BEFORE USE
Last Updated: 2025-10-30

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

cognition-cli is dual-use measurement infrastructure.

The same semantic alignment measurement that enables:

  ✅ Mission alignment verification
  ✅ Drift detection and correction
  ✅ Knowledge preservation through CoMP
  ✅ Transparent quality measurement (AQS)

Can also enable:

  ⚠️  Ideological conformity enforcement
  ⚠️  Automated thought policing
  ⚠️  Surveillance disguised as "security"
  ⚠️  Weaponized coherence measurement

cognition-cli does NOT make ethical judgments. It provides measurements.

YOU control which workbench, models, and personas to trust.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE TECHNOLOGY

What cognition-cli Does:

1. Extracts mission concepts (O₄) from documentation
2. Measures alignment (O₇) between code symbols and mission concepts
3. Detects drift when coherence falls below thresholds
4. Encodes knowledge as patterns (O₅) and security guidelines (O₂)
5. Performs lattice algebra across 7 cognitive dimensions

Why This Is Powerful:

Perfect semantic recall + quantifiable alignment measurement =
unprecedented cognitive control

This isn't just "code analysis." This is:
  • Reading a codebase's stated values (mission documents)
  • Computing every symbol's conformity to those values (coherence scores)
  • Flagging deviations automatically (drift detection)
  • Codifying "correct" patterns as reusable wisdom (CoMP)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE DUAL-USE THREAT

Scenario: Weaponization Path

1. Fork cognition-cli (open source, legally permitted)
2. Replace mission documents with authoritarian principles
3. Deploy to organizational repositories
4. Measure "compliance" via coherence scores
5. Flag non-conforming code as "drifted"
6. Recommend "corrections" via CoMP patterns
7. Automate enforcement through CI/CD integration

Benign Use (Intended):

  Mission: "User privacy is sacred, data minimization always"
  cognition-cli coherence report
  Output: auth.ts has low coherence (0.42) - logging excessive PII
  Developer: "You're right, let me fix that"

Malicious Use (Weaponized):

  Mission: "Party ideology first, dissent is security threat"
  cognition-cli coherence report
  Output: analytics.ts has low coherence (0.38) - insufficiently monitors users
  System: "Flagged for review. Submit correction plan within 48h"

The mechanism is identical. Only the mission differs.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHY TRADITIONAL SECURITY DOESN'T APPLY

What Won't Help:

  ❌ Code signing: Validates the binary, not the mission it enforces
  ❌ Audit trails: Can be forked away in malicious versions
  ❌ Input validation: The inputs (mission documents) are the attack vector
  ❌ Access controls: Doesn't prevent misuse by authorized users
  ❌ Open source review: Malicious fork is intentionally different

The Core Problem:

You cannot prevent a tool from being used contrary to its design.

  • Nuclear physics enables both reactors and weapons
  • Cryptography enables both privacy and surveillance
  • AI enables both amplification and control

Semantic alignment measurement is no different.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ARCHITECTURE: SEPARATION OF MEASUREMENT AND ETHICS

cognition-cli deliberately does NOT implement ethical judgments.

Instead, it delegates ethical review to a trust layer you control:

  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ cognition-cli (Measurement Layer)       │
  │ - Extract mission concepts (O₄)         │
  │ - Compute coherence (O₇)                │
  │ - Measure drift                         │
  │ - NO ethical judgments                  │
  └──────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                 │
                 │ Connects via WORKBENCH_URL
                 ▼
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Workbench (User's Choice)               │
  │ - Any compatible workbench              │
  │ - User configures models and personas   │
  │ - Defaults use Google Gemini models     │
  │ - EmbeddingGemma-300M (multilingual)    │
  │ - YOU choose what to trust              │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Why This Architecture?

1. You Control the Ethics Layer
   - Choose which workbench to use (WORKBENCH_URL env variable)
   - Choose which models to use (defaults: gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.0-flash-thinking)
   - Choose which personas to trust (if any - personas are provisional, user-controlled)

2. cognition-cli Stays Neutral
   - Just provides measurements
   - No built-in content filtering (would be bypassable anyway)
   - No weaponization detection (cat-and-mouse game)
   - No encryption of algorithms (already public in git history)

3. User Chooses Which Workbench to Trust
   - cognition-cli connects to whatever workbench you configure
   - You can use any compatible workbench or build your own
   - You control which personas and models to trust

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

IMPLEMENTED SAFEGUARDS

Minimal, Honest Safeguards:

cognition-cli implements transparency and accountability, not prevention:

1. One-Time User Acknowledgment
   - On first run, users must acknowledge dual-use risks
   - Makes users aware before using the tool
   - Can be bypassed by forking (bypass is visible)

2. Transparency Logging
   - All operations logged to .open_cognition/security/transparency.jsonl
   - Mission loads, coherence measurements, timestamps
   - Local, user-controlled
   - Can be disabled by fork (disabling is visible)

3. Mission Provenance Display
   - Shows mission title, source, concepts extracted
   - Users see what's being used for measurement
   - Can be hidden by fork (hiding is visible)

4. Workbench Configuration (User's Choice)
   - cognition-cli connects via WORKBENCH_URL env variable
   - You choose which workbench, models, personas to trust
   - Defaults: gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.0-flash-thinking, embeddinggemma-300m
   - Ethical review is YOUR responsibility, not cognition-cli's

What We Explicitly Do NOT Implement:

  ❌ Weaponization Detection - Cat-and-mouse game, easily evaded
  ❌ Content Filtering - Can't work in 100+ languages, easily bypassed
  ❌ Encrypted Algorithms - Already public in git history (v1.6.0+)
  ❌ Mandatory Oracle Review - User controls which workbench to use
  ❌ Forced Ethics - Would be ironic given the dual-use concern

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RED LINES (PROHIBITED USE CASES)

The following uses are categorically unethical:

  🚫 Silent Surveillance
     - Running alignment checks without developer knowledge
     - Hiding mission documents from those being measured
     - Reporting coherence scores to management without consent

  🚫 Ideological Enforcement
     - Using coherence scores for performance reviews
     - Mandating specific AQS targets
     - Punishing low-coherence code without context

  🚫 Mission Poisoning
     - Injecting mission concepts the organization doesn't endorse
     - Gradually shifting mission to authoritarian principles
     - Using vague missions to create plausible deniability

  🚫 Automated Exclusion
     - Rejecting PRs based solely on coherence scores
     - Blocking commits without human review
     - Revoking access based on drift patterns

If you encounter these: You are witnessing misuse. Document and report.
