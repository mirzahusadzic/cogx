The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.8.0] - 2025-11-01

### üéâ Self-Cognition - "The Lattice Explains Itself"

This release achieves **Block 4 (Self-Cognition)** - the system can now query and explain its own knowledge. The new `ask` command enables natural language queries across the entire knowledge lattice with semantic synthesis and provenance tracking. **15 commits** spanning semantic Q&A, frontmatter validation, enhanced extraction, quest logging, and documentation.

### Major Features

#### 1. Semantic Q&A System - `cognition-cli ask`

The flagship feature enabling true self-cognition through natural language queries:

- **Natural language queries** across the entire knowledge lattice
  - Example: `cognition-cli ask "what is cPOW used for?"`
  - Cross-overlay synthesis (queries O‚ÇÅ-O‚Çá simultaneously)
  - 2-3 second response times
- **Semantic matching with confidence scores**
  - Each source shows match percentage (e.g., "71.8% match")
  - Results ranked by semantic relevance
  - Pulls from multiple overlays for comprehensive answers
- **Synthesized answers with provenance**
  - AI-generated answer combining all relevant sources
  - Source citations with overlay tags (O‚ÇÑ, O‚ÇÖ, O‚ÇÅ, etc.)
  - Complete transparency of knowledge lineage
- **Multi-overlay semantic search**
  - Automatically searches across all relevant overlays
  - Cross-layer synthesis (Chapter 11 - O‚Çá Coherence in action)
  - Intelligent source selection and ranking

**Implementation:**
- `src/commands/ask.ts` - New command entry point
- Enhanced `QueryService` with semantic Q&A capabilities
- Integration with existing overlay infrastructure
- Reuses semantic embeddings from PGC

#### 2. 100% Classification Confidence

YAML frontmatter infrastructure for authoritative document metadata:

- **Frontmatter-based classification**
  - Parser extracts YAML frontmatter using js-yaml
  - Frontmatter treated as authoritative (1.0 confidence)
  - Overrides ML-based classification when present
- **All 15 manual documents validated**
  - Each doc has explicit `type` and `overlay` metadata
  - 100% classification confidence across entire manual
  - Validation enforces 75% threshold
- **Validation infrastructure**
  - `test-manual-classification.ts` validator
  - Ensures all manual docs meet quality threshold
  - Prevents regression in document classification

**Example frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
type: architectural
overlay: O4_Mission
---
```

#### 3. Enhanced Document Extraction

Generalized extraction system for comprehensive documentation capture:

- **WorkflowExtractor generalized**
  - Now handles all documentation types (not just workflows)
  - Section heading-based extraction
  - Captures explanatory content ("What is X?" sections)
- **"What is X?" extraction fixed**
  - Properly extracts definition sections
  - Preserves context from section headings
  - Better semantic chunking
- **Force re-ingestion support**
  - `genesis:docs --force` flag added
  - Allows document updates without PGC reset
  - Useful for iterative documentation improvements

#### 4. Quest Operations Logging (Block 2 - Lops)

Infrastructure for transparency logging and quest execution tracking:

- **Transparency logging system**
  - Logs all quest operations to `.open_cognition/logs/`
  - Tracks command execution, duration, and outcomes
  - Foundation for cPOW lineage tracking
- **Quest execution provenance**
  - Links operations to specific quests
  - Enables audit trail for cognitive work
  - Supports Block 2 (Lops) requirements

#### 5. Sacred Pause Formalization

Documentation of the three Oracle Meeting Points:

- **Oracle Meeting Points documented**
  - Three-phase decision framework
  - Depth-based quality gates
  - Formalized pause criteria

### Changed

## [1.6.0] - 2025-10-28

### üéâ The Shadow + Monument 5.1 - "Lattice-aware Gaussian Weighting"

This release introduces two major innovations building on the defensive publication:

#### Innovation #26: Monument 4.7 - The Shadow

- Dual embedding system for structural and semantic signatures
- Structural embeddings based on AST patterns
- Semantic embeddings based on docstring + type signatures
- Enables both code pattern matching AND mission alignment queries

#### Innovation #27: Monument 5.1 - Lattice-aware Gaussian Weighting

- Pure lattice-based coherence eliminating all hardcoded constants
- Gaussian statistics for signal/noise separation (filters symbols below Œº - œÉ)
- Graph centrality from O‚ÇÅ reverse_deps (logarithmic scaling)
- Three-tier coherence metrics: Average, Weighted, Lattice

### Added

- **Lattice coherence metric** using pure mathematical derivation
  - Weight formula: `w = centrality √ó gaussian_significance`
  - `centrality = log10(dependency_count + 1)`
  - `gaussian_significance = max(0.1, 1.0 + z_score)`
  - NO HARDCODED CONSTANTS - all derived from lattice structure
- **Gaussian noise filtering** - excludes symbols below Œº - œÉ (z-score < -1.0)
- **Cross-overlay synthesis** - O‚ÇÅ (structure) + O‚ÇÉ (mission) + statistics
- **Debug logging** for centrality calculations with dependency counts
- **Enhanced coherence report** showing all three metrics with deltas

### Fixed

- **Critical bug**: PGCManager initialization in StrategicCoherenceManager
  - Was passing `pgcRoot` instead of `projectRoot`
  - Created incorrect paths (`.open_cognition/.open_cognition/...`)
  - Caused lattice coherence to always return 0%
  - Now correctly passes parent directory via `path.dirname()`

### Results

- **Lattice coherence**: 57.7% (+3.0% from baseline)
- **Gaussian filtering**: Successfully filtering statistical noise
- **Centrality weighting**: Working correctly from reverse_deps
- **Verification**: Debug logs confirm proper dependency lookups

### Documentation

- Updated README with Innovations #26-27
- Updated Zenodo DOI to 10.5281/zenodo.17466998
- Comprehensive release notes on GitHub
- JSDoc comments for all lattice-aware functions
