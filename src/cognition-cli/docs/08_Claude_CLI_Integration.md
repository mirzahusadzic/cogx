# 08 - Claude Code Integration: AI + PGC Symbiosis

**How `cognition-cli` and Claude Code work together to create a living, grounded development environment.**

---

## Overview

The `cognition-cli` is designed to work seamlessly with **Claude Code** (Anthropic's official CLI tool). Together, they create a powerful symbiosis:

- **Claude Code**: AI-powered coding assistant with deep reasoning capabilities
- **cognition-cli**: Verifiable, grounded knowledge graph of your codebase
- **The Result**: AI reasoning that is anchored in cryptographic truth, not statistical approximation

This guide shows how to integrate the two tools for maximum effectiveness.

---

## The `.claude/commands/` System

### How It Works

Claude Code supports **slash commands** defined as markdown files in the `.claude/commands/` directory. When you type `/command-name`, Claude Code expands the corresponding markdown file as a prompt.

**The cognition-cli already includes living guides in this format:**

```text
cognition-cli/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ watch.md        # Guide for watch command
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ status.md       # Guide for status command
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ update.md       # Guide for update command
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ explore-architecture.md  # AI architecture exploration
```text

### Using Guides as Slash Commands

In Claude Code, you can run:

```text
/watch     ‚Üí Shows the watch command guide
/status    ‚Üí Shows the status command guide
/update    ‚Üí Shows the update command guide
```text

Claude Code will read the markdown, understand the command's purpose, options, and examples, then help you use it effectively!

### Creating Custom Integration Commands

You can create your own `.claude/commands/` that leverage cognition-cli:

**Example: `.claude/commands/analyze-impact.md`**

```markdown
# Analyze Impact of Changes

Please analyze the impact of my recent changes using the PGC:

1. Run `cognition-cli status --verbose` to see which symbols are affected
2. For each affected symbol, run `cognition-cli blast-radius <symbol>` to understand downstream impact
3. Summarize the architectural implications
4. Suggest if changes should be split into multiple commits based on blast radius

Be thorough and provide specific examples from the output.
```text

Now `/analyze-impact` becomes a custom workflow!

---

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Grounded Architecture Exploration

**Scenario**: You want Claude to understand your codebase architecture without reading thousands of lines of code.

**Workflow:**

1. **Build the PGC**:

   ```bash
   cognition-cli init
   cognition-cli genesis src/
   cognition-cli overlay generate structural_patterns
   ```text

2. **In Claude Code, use PGC commands**:

   ```text
   User: /explore-architecture

   Claude: I'll analyze your architecture using the PGC...
   [Runs cognition-cli patterns list]
   [Runs cognition-cli patterns analyze]
   [Provides architectural insights based on structural patterns]
   ```text

3. **Claude reasons about your architecture** using grounded data, not hallucinations:
   - Identifies architectural roles (components, services, utilities)
   - Shows dependency patterns
   - Suggests refactoring opportunities
   - All grounded in verifiable PGC data!

**Why it works**: Claude Code can run `cognition-cli` commands and reason about their structured output. The PGC provides ground truth, and Claude provides interpretation.

### Pattern 2: Coherence-Aware Development

**Scenario**: You're coding and want to ensure PGC stays synchronized with your changes.

**Workflow:**

1. **Terminal 1: Start the watcher**

   ```bash
   cognition-cli watch
   ```text

2. **Terminal 2: Work with Claude Code**

   ```text
   User: Please refactor the authentication logic in src/auth.ts

   Claude: [Makes changes using Edit tool]

   # Watch detects changes:
   # ‚úó src/auth.ts
   # Detected change: src/auth.ts
   ```text

3. **Check impact before committing**:

   ```text
   User: What's the PGC status?

   Claude: [Runs cognition-cli status --verbose]

   üéê PGC Status: INCOHERENT
   Summary:
     Modified files: 1
     Impacted symbols: 8

   Modified Files:
     ‚úó src/auth.ts
       Symbols: validateCredentials, createSession, destroySession,
                refreshToken, checkPermissions, encryptToken,
                decryptToken, hashPassword

   Claude: "8 symbols were affected by the refactoring. This is a medium-sized
   change that impacts core authentication functions. I recommend running
   `cognition-cli update` before committing to ensure the PGC is synchronized."
   ```text

4. **Update and verify**:

   ```text
   User: Please update the PGC

   Claude: [Runs cognition-cli update]
   ‚úì Update complete - PGC is coherent

   Claude: "PGC is now synchronized. Safe to commit!"
   ```text

**Why it works**: Claude Code can monitor PGC coherence and advise on when to update, creating a feedback loop between AI-driven changes and verifiable knowledge.

### Pattern 3: Impact-Aware Refactoring

**Scenario**: You want to refactor a component but need to understand the blast radius first.

**Workflow:**

1. **Analyze before refactoring**:

   ```text
   User: I want to refactor PGCManager. What's the impact?

   Claude: [Runs cognition-cli blast-radius PGCManager]

   üî• Blast Radius Analysis: PGCManager

   Total Impact: 47 symbols affected
   Direct Consumers: 15 files
   Maximum Depth: 4 levels
   Risk Level: HIGH ‚ö†Ô∏è

   Critical Paths:
     PGCManager ‚Üí GenesisOrchestrator ‚Üí StructuralMiner ‚Üí WorkbenchClient
     PGCManager ‚Üí UpdateOrchestrator ‚Üí DirtyStateManager
     PGCManager ‚Üí Index ‚Üí StatusCommand

   Claude: "‚ö†Ô∏è This is a HIGH RISK refactoring! PGCManager has 15 direct consumers
   and affects 47 symbols total, with changes propagating up to 4 levels deep.

   I recommend:
   1. Create comprehensive tests for critical paths first
   2. Consider interface-preserving refactoring
   3. Split changes into smaller, incremental commits
   4. Review each critical path after changes"
   ```text

2. **Make informed decisions**:
   - Claude understands the architectural impact
   - Can suggest safer refactoring strategies
   - Warns about high-risk changes
   - All based on verifiable PGC data!

**Why it works**: The `blast-radius` command provides quantifiable impact metrics that Claude can reason about, leading to safer refactoring decisions.

### Pattern 4: Pre-Commit Quality Checks

**Scenario**: You want to ensure code quality and PGC coherence before every commit.

**Create `.claude/commands/pre-commit-check.md`:**

```markdown
# Pre-Commit Quality Check

Run a comprehensive quality check before committing:

1. **Check PGC Coherence**:
   - Run `cognition-cli status --verbose`
   - If incoherent, show which symbols are affected
   - Calculate blast radius for major changes

2. **Analyze Commit Size**:
   - Small impact (1-5 symbols) ‚Üí Good commit! ‚úÖ
   - Medium impact (6-15 symbols) ‚Üí Review for cohesion
   - Large impact (15+ symbols) ‚Üí Suggest splitting commits

3. **Run Tests** (if test command exists):
   - Run project's test suite
   - Report any failures

4. **Provide Summary**:
   - Coherence status
   - Impact analysis
   - Test results
   - Recommendation: Safe to commit / Needs attention

Be thorough and provide actionable feedback.
```text

**Usage:**

```text
User: /pre-commit-check

Claude: Running pre-commit quality checks...

‚úÖ PGC Coherence: COHERENT
üìä Impact Analysis:
   - Modified files: 2
   - Impacted symbols: 7 (medium)
   - Blast radius: Contained within auth module

üß™ Tests: All 147 tests passing

‚úÖ RECOMMENDATION: Safe to commit!
   This is a focused change affecting only the authentication module.
   Consider commit message: "refactor(auth): improve session management"
```text

**Why it works**: Automates the quality check workflow using PGC data + test results, giving you confidence before committing.

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep PGC and Claude Code in Sync

**Always run watch during Claude Code sessions:**

```bash
# Terminal 1
cognition-cli watch

# Terminal 2
claude  # Start Claude Code
```text

This ensures dirty_state is always up-to-date, allowing Claude to give accurate coherence feedback.

### 2. Use Status for Commit Decisions

**Before committing, ask Claude:**

```text
User: Check PGC status before I commit

Claude: [Runs cognition-cli status --verbose]
Modified files: 3
Impacted symbols: 12

Claude: "Medium-sized change. Consider reviewing if these 3 files
represent a cohesive feature or should be split into separate commits."
```text

This creates a feedback loop where **blast radius informs commit granularity**.

### 3. Leverage Guides for Context

**Instead of explaining commands, reference guides:**

```text
User: How does the update command work?

Claude: Let me check the guide...
[Reads .claude/commands/update.md]

Claude: "Update implements the Invalidate algorithm from CogX. It reads
dirty_state.json, re-processes changed files, updates the PGC, and runs
Oracle verification. It's optimized to skip verification if no files actually
changed. Here's an example..."
```text

The guides **ship with the tool**, so Claude always has accurate, version-specific documentation!

### 4. Create Domain-Specific Commands

**Example for security-focused projects:**

**`.claude/commands/security-audit.md`:**

```markdown
# Security-Focused Codebase Audit

Perform a security-oriented analysis using PGC:

1. List all files with "auth", "password", "token", "secret" in their names
2. Run `cognition-cli patterns list --role service` to find service components
3. For each auth-related service, run `cognition-cli blast-radius <service>`
4. Identify critical paths that touch authentication/authorization
5. Highlight any high-risk changes (large blast radius)
6. Suggest security-focused test coverage

Focus on architectural security, not code-level vulnerabilities.
```text

### 5. Integrate with Git Workflows

**Pre-commit hook using PGC:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

echo "üîç Checking PGC coherence..."

if ! cognition-cli status --json > /dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "üéê PGC is incoherent. Running update..."

  if cognition-cli update; then
    echo "‚úÖ PGC updated successfully"
  else
    echo "‚ùå PGC update failed - blocking commit"
    exit 1
  fi
fi

echo "üîî PGC is coherent - proceeding with commit"
```text

**Ask Claude to set this up:**

```text
User: Create a pre-commit hook that ensures PGC coherence

Claude: [Creates the hook script above]
Claude: [Makes it executable with chmod +x]

Claude: "Pre-commit hook installed! Now every commit will ensure the PGC
is synchronized with your code changes."
```text

---

## Advanced Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Multi-Agent Coordination (Future)

**Once Monument 4 & 5 are built:**

```text
# Agent 1 (Claude Code instance 1)
User: Refactor auth module

# Agent 2 (Claude Code instance 2) - working on related code
User: Update user profile management

# cognition-cli watch detects conflicts:
# ‚Üí Agent 1 modifies validateCredentials
# ‚Üí Update Function calculates Delta for Agent 2
# ‚Üí Delta(Agent 2) > Delta_crit
# ‚Üí Agent 2 paused and notified

Agent 2: "‚ö†Ô∏è Detected context disturbance from parallel changes in
auth module. Syncing with latest PGC state before continuing..."

[Runs cognition-cli update]
[Resumes work with fresh context]
```text

This is the **multi-agent coordination** from CogX blueprint - enabled by Monument 1-3!

### Scenario 2: Semantic Code Search with AI

```text
User: Find all functions that are structurally similar to validateUser

Claude: [Runs cognition-cli patterns find-similar validateUser --top-k 10]

Found 10 similar patterns:
1. validateCredentials (0.94 similarity)
2. checkPermissions (0.89 similarity)
3. verifyToken (0.87 similarity)
...

Claude: "Based on structural similarity, these functions share validation
patterns with validateUser. They all:
- Take a single object parameter
- Return boolean or throw errors
- Use similar dependency injection patterns
- Follow the validator architectural role

Would you like me to analyze if they could share a common abstraction?"
```text

### Scenario 3: Continuous Integration with PGC

**GitHub Actions workflow:**

```yaml
name: PGC Coherence Check

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  pgc-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3

      - name: Install cognition-cli
        run: npm install -g @your-org/cognition-cli

      - name: Check PGC coherence
        run: |
          cognition-cli status --json > status.json
          if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo "‚ùå PGC is incoherent with code changes"
            exit 1
          fi

      - name: Analyze impact
        run: |
          SYMBOLS=$(jq '.summary.totalImpact' status.json)
          echo "Total symbols impacted: $SYMBOLS"

          if [ $SYMBOLS -gt 50 ]; then
            echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Large impact detected ($SYMBOLS symbols)"
            echo "Consider splitting this PR into smaller changes"
          fi
```text

**Ask Claude to generate this:**

```text
User: Create a GitHub Actions workflow that checks PGC coherence on PRs

Claude: [Creates the YAML file above]

Claude: "This workflow will:
1. Run cognition-cli status on every PR
2. Block merging if PGC is incoherent
3. Warn if impact is large (>50 symbols)
4. Encourage smaller, focused changes

This enforces PGC coherence as part of your CI/CD pipeline!"
```text

---

## Troubleshooting

### Claude Can't Find cognition-cli

**Problem**: Claude Code can't execute `cognition-cli` commands.

**Solution**: Ensure cognition-cli is in your PATH:

```bash
# Check if cognition-cli is accessible
which cognition-cli

# If not, link it globally
cd /path/to/cognition-cli
npm link

# Or add to PATH in your shell config
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/cognition-cli/dist"
```text

### Slash Commands Not Working

**Problem**: `/watch`, `/status` commands not recognized by Claude Code.

**Solution**: Ensure `.claude/commands/` directory is in your project root or cognition-cli root:

```bash
# Check if commands exist
ls -la .claude/commands/

# Should show:
# watch.md
# status.md
# update.md
# explore-architecture.md
```text

Claude Code will find these automatically!

### Watch Not Detecting Changes

**Problem**: Files change but `cognition-cli status` still shows coherent.

**Solution**: Ensure `watch` is running:

```bash
# Check if watch is running
ps aux | grep "cognition-cli watch"

# If not, start it
cognition-cli watch --verbose
```text

**Remember**: Status only reads `dirty_state.json`. Without watch running, this file isn't updated!

### Scenario 4: AI-Guided Architectural Analysis

```text
User: Analyze the architectural patterns in my codebase

Claude: I'll analyze using the PGC overlays...

[Runs cognition-cli patterns analyze --verbose]

Architecture Distribution:
  Components: 47 (35%)
  Services: 32 (24%)
  Utilities: 28 (21%)
  Types: 19 (14%)
  Controllers: 8 (6%)

[Runs cognition-cli patterns list --role component]
[Analyzes component patterns]

Claude: "Your codebase follows a service-oriented architecture with:
- Strong component layer (47 components)
- Well-defined service layer (32 services)
- Good separation of concerns (utilities isolated)

However, I notice only 8 controllers - this suggests most logic is in
services, which is good! The 47 components indicate a modular frontend.

Would you like me to analyze specific architectural patterns or
find similar components for refactoring?"
```text

### Scenario 5: Dependency Tracing with AI Context

```text
User: Trace all dependencies of handleRequest function

Claude: [Runs cognition-cli query handleRequest --depth 3 --lineage]

Dependency Lineage (depth 3):
  handleRequest
    ‚Üí validateRequest
      ‚Üí checkSchema
        ‚Üí schemaValidator
      ‚Üí sanitizeInput
    ‚Üí processRequest
      ‚Üí authMiddleware
        ‚Üí verifyToken
      ‚Üí businessLogic
    ‚Üí formatResponse

Claude: "handleRequest has a clear 3-layer structure:
1. Validation layer (validateRequest ‚Üí checkSchema + sanitizeInput)
2. Processing layer (processRequest ‚Üí auth + businessLogic)
3. Formatting layer (formatResponse)

This shows good separation of concerns. If you refactor handleRequest,
you'll need to ensure the 9 downstream functions maintain their contracts."
```text

---

## Integration with All cognition-cli Commands

### Genesis Command Integration

**Create `.claude/commands/rebuild-pgc.md`:**

```markdown
# Rebuild PGC from Scratch

Rebuild the PGC after major changes:

1. Run `cognition-cli init` (if not already initialized)
2. Run `cognition-cli genesis src/` to build the knowledge graph
3. Run `cognition-cli overlay generate structural_patterns`
4. Run `cognition-cli overlay generate lineage_patterns`
5. Provide a summary of what was indexed

Show progress and any errors encountered.
```text

**Usage:**

```text
User: /rebuild-pgc

Claude: Rebuilding PGC from scratch...

‚úÖ PGC initialized
[Running genesis on src/...]
  Found 247 files
  Parsed 247 files successfully
  ‚úÖ Genesis complete

[Generating structural patterns...]
  Processed 3,847 symbols
  Generated 3,847 pattern entries
  ‚úÖ Structural patterns generated

[Generating lineage patterns...]
  Analyzed 2,156 dependencies
  Built lineage graph
  ‚úÖ Lineage patterns generated

üìä PGC Summary:
  - Files indexed: 247
  - Total symbols: 3,847
  - Dependency links: 2,156
  - Storage size: 45.2 MB

Your PGC is now ready for grounded AI reasoning!
```text

### Overlay Commands Integration

**Create `.claude/commands/refresh-overlays.md`:**

```markdown
# Refresh PGC Overlays

Regenerate pattern overlays when code structure changes significantly:

1. Run `cognition-cli overlay generate structural_patterns . --force`
2. Run `cognition-cli overlay generate lineage_patterns . --force`
3. Report any errors or warnings
4. Show updated pattern statistics

Use this after major refactoring or branch switches.
```text

### Patterns Commands Integration

**Create `.claude/commands/find-refactor-candidates.md`:**

```markdown
# Find Refactoring Candidates

Use pattern similarity to find refactoring opportunities:

1. Run `cognition-cli patterns list` to get all symbols
2. For highly similar patterns (>0.9 similarity), suggest:
   - Extracting common abstractions
   - Creating base classes/interfaces
   - Applying DRY principles
3. Focus on architectural roles (component, service, utility)
4. Provide specific examples with pattern names

Be practical and suggest concrete refactorings.
```text

**Usage:**

```text
User: /find-refactor-candidates

Claude: Analyzing structural patterns for refactoring opportunities...

[Runs cognition-cli patterns list]
[Runs cognition-cli patterns find-similar for key components]

üîç Refactoring Candidates Found:

1. **User Management Patterns** (0.94 similarity):
   - UserManager
   - AdminManager
   - GuestManager

   üí° Suggestion: These share 94% structural similarity. Consider:
   - Extract common interface: IAccountManager
   - Create base class: BaseAccountManager
   - Reduce code duplication by ~180 lines

2. **Data Validators** (0.91 similarity):
   - EmailValidator
   - PhoneValidator
   - URLValidator

   üí° Suggestion: These follow the same validation pattern. Consider:
   - Create ValidatorStrategy interface
   - Implement strategy pattern
   - Enable easier addition of new validators

Would you like me to implement any of these refactorings?
```text

### Blast-Radius Commands Integration

**Create `.claude/commands/safe-refactor.md`:**

```markdown
# Safe Refactoring Workflow

Perform refactoring with impact awareness:

1. Ask user which component they want to refactor
2. Run `cognition-cli blast-radius <component> --json`
3. Analyze the impact:
   - If risk is LOW: Proceed with confidence
   - If risk is MEDIUM: Warn and suggest caution
   - If risk is HIGH/CRITICAL: Strongly advise against or suggest safer approach
4. If proceeding, show critical paths that need testing
5. After refactoring, recommend which tests to run/create

Make risk-aware refactoring decisions.
```text

**Usage:**

```text
User: /safe-refactor
Which component would you like to refactor?

User: AuthService

Claude: [Runs cognition-cli blast-radius AuthService --json]

‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH RISK REFACTORING DETECTED**

Blast Radius Analysis for AuthService:
  - Total Impact: 47 symbols
  - Direct Consumers: 15 files
  - Maximum Depth: 4 levels
  - Risk Level: HIGH ‚ö†Ô∏è

Critical Paths:
  1. AuthService ‚Üí LoginController ‚Üí UserDashboard ‚Üí RoleManager
  2. AuthService ‚Üí PermissionChecker ‚Üí AdminPanel ‚Üí AuditLog
  3. AuthService ‚Üí SessionManager ‚Üí WebSocketServer ‚Üí RealTimeNotif

‚ö†Ô∏è **RECOMMENDATION**: This is a critical component with deep dependencies.

Safer approach:
1. Add comprehensive integration tests for all 3 critical paths
2. Implement changes behind a feature flag
3. Refactor incrementally, one path at a time
4. Verify each path with tests before moving to the next

Shall I help create tests for the critical paths first?
```text

### Query Commands Integration

**Create `.claude/commands/trace-dependency.md`:**

```markdown
# Trace Dependency Chain

Trace how one component depends on another:

1. Ask user for source and target components
2. Run `cognition-cli query <source> --depth 5 --lineage`
3. Parse the JSON output to find paths to target
4. Visualize the dependency chain
5. Identify intermediary components
6. Suggest if relationship is direct or transitive

Help understand complex dependency relationships.
```text

### Audit Commands Integration

**Create `.claude/commands/verify-provenance.md`:**

```markdown
# Verify File Provenance

Audit the transformation history of a file:

1. Ask user which file to audit
2. Run `cognition-cli audit:transformations <file> --limit 10`
3. Show the transformation history:
   - Transform IDs
   - Methods used (native-ast, egemma-parse, etc.)
   - Timestamps
   - Verification status
4. Highlight any failed verifications or anomalies
5. Explain the provenance chain in human terms

Useful for debugging or ensuring data integrity.
```text

**Usage:**

```text
User: /verify-provenance
Which file should I audit?

User: src/core/auth.ts

Claude: [Runs cognition-cli audit:transformations src/core/auth.ts --limit 10]

üìú Transformation History for src/core/auth.ts

Last 10 Transformations:

1. 2025-10-24 08:33:11
   Transform ID: a74c49f8
   Method: native-ast-parse
   Fidelity: 0.95
   Status: ‚úÖ Verified
   Operation: Incremental update (Monument 3)

2. 2025-10-23 14:22:05
   Transform ID: b3b5b9a2
   Method: native-ast-parse
   Fidelity: 0.95
   Status: ‚úÖ Verified
   Operation: Genesis initial parse

... (8 more entries)

‚úÖ **Provenance Chain: VERIFIED**

All transformations passed Oracle verification. The file's history is
complete and cryptographically verifiable back to genesis.

This means you can trust that the PGC's understanding of this file is
grounded in actual code, not hallucination.
```text

## What's Next

### Monument 4: Context Sampling (Œ£) + Field of View

Once implemented, you'll be able to:

```text
User: What code is relevant to implementing OAuth?

Claude: [Runs cognition-cli context-sample --goal "implement OAuth"]

Context Sample (Œ£):
  - auth.service.ts (high relevance: 0.92)
  - jwt.middleware.ts (high relevance: 0.88)
  - user.model.ts (medium relevance: 0.67)

Field of View: 3 files, 847 tokens

Claude: "I've sampled the most relevant context for OAuth implementation.
These 3 files contain the authentication infrastructure you'll build on."
```text

### Monument 5: Multi-Agent Delta Calculation

When multiple Claude instances work simultaneously:

```text
# Agent 1 modifies AuthService
# ‚Üí Update Function calculates Delta
# ‚Üí Agent 2's context overlap detected
# ‚Üí Agent 2 paused if Delta > Delta_crit

Claude (Agent 2): "‚ö†Ô∏è Detected parallel changes in auth module by another
agent. Synchronizing before continuing to avoid conflicts..."
```text

The PGC becomes the **coordination layer** for multi-agent AI collaboration!
