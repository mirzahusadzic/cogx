# Cognition CLI Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Cognition Command-Line Interface (CLI). This section provides an in-depth look into the architecture, functionality, and usage of the `cognition-cli`.

## üéâ Breakthrough: Pure Grounded AI Analysis

**[Document 07](./07_AI_Grounded_Architecture_Analysis.md)** marks a historic milestone - the first architecture analysis generated through pure grounded AI reasoning, with **zero source file reading**.

The AI analyzed cognition-cli's architecture using only:

- `cognition-cli patterns analyze`
- `cognition-cli blast-radius`
- PGC structured metadata

Every claim is verifiable, reproducible, and backed by cryptographic truth. This is the future of AI-assisted development.

## ü§ù Monument 1-3: The Symbiosis

**[Document 08](./08_Claude_CLI_Integration.md)** demonstrates the practical symbiosis between Claude Code and cognition-cli's event-driven architecture (Monument 1-3).

Using the `.claude/commands/` system, developers can:

- Get instant coherence checks before commits (`/pre-commit-check`)
- Perform risk-aware refactoring with blast radius analysis (`/safe-refactor`)
- Discover refactoring opportunities through pattern similarity (`/find-refactor-candidates`)
- Verify transformation provenance and data integrity (`/verify-provenance`)
- Trace dependency chains and architectural relationships (`/trace-dependency`)

All AI reasoning is grounded in verifiable PGC data, enabling impact-aware code assistance with cryptographic guarantees.
