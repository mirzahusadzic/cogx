## üéâ Breakthrough: Pure Grounded AI Analysis

**[Document 08](./08_AI_Grounded_Architecture_Analysis.md)** marks a historic milestone - the first architecture analysis generated through pure grounded AI reasoning, with **zero source file reading**.

The AI analyzed cognition-cli's architecture using only:

- `cognition-cli patterns analyze`
- `cognition-cli blast-radius`
- PGC structured metadata

Every claim is verifiable, reproducible, and backed by cryptographic truth. This is the future of AI-assisted development.
