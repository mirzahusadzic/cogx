# THE LATTICE BOOK

> **A Reference Manual for Cognitive Architecture with Verifiable Overlays**

Version: 1.0 (In Progress)
Status: Living Document
Last Updated: November 3, 2025

## The Axiom: Knowledge is a Lattice

**This is not an analogy. This is not a metaphor. This is a formal mathematical truth.**

Every question you ask—"What depends on X?", "Where is Y used?", "What changed between versions?"—is a **lattice operation**. Knowledge, in its most fundamental form, has the structure of a **mathematical lattice**: a partially ordered set where any two elements have both a unique greatest lower bound (Meet, ∧) and a unique least upper bound (Join, ∨).

The Grounded Context Pool (PGC) is not "like" a lattice. **It IS a lattice**—the first executable implementation of this formal truth.

---

## About This Book

THE LATTICE BOOK is the complete reference manual for building, querying, and reasoning about cognitive architectures using the Open Cognition system. This is not just documentation—it's **executable knowledge** that can be ingested into the very system it describes.

**Why "The Lattice Book"?**

- **Lattice**: Not metaphor—mathematical structure with provable properties
- **Open**: Transparent, inspectable, portable cognition
- **Living**: Grows with the codebase, not written after the fact
- **Executable**: The book itself becomes a .cogx artifact

**Core Insight**: When you query "O2 ∧ O4" (security Meet mission), you're not searching—you're computing the greatest lower bound in a knowledge lattice. This is why compositional queries work. This is why overlays compose. This is why the algebra is complete.

**Scope**: This book covers the complete implementation from foundational axioms through advanced query algebra, portability formats (.cogx), and the computational Proof of Work (cPOW) loop.

---

## Target Audience

- **Implementers**: Building cognitive architectures
- **Researchers**: Understanding overlay-based knowledge systems
- **AI Engineers**: Integrating with LLM workflows
- **Security Analysts**: Auditing cognitive systems
- **Future You**: When context is lost and complexity is overwhelming

**Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of TypeScript, embeddings, and graph theory helps but isn't required.

## Contributing

This book grows **with** the codebase, not after. When you implement a feature:

1. **Write the chapter** (or update existing)
2. **Include examples** (real code, real queries)
3. **Document design decisions** (why not what)
4. **Update this index**

**Format Guidelines**:

- Use code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Include visual diagrams (ASCII art is fine)
- Real examples from the codebase
- "Why" over "what" (code shows what, docs explain why)

---

## Meta: The Book as Overlay

Eventually, THE LATTICE BOOK itself becomes a `.cogx` artifact:

```bash
# Ingest the book into PGC
cognition-cli genesis:docs docs/manual/

# Query the book
cognition-cli lattice "O5 -> O2"
# "Which operational patterns ensure security?"
# Returns: Excerpts from Chapter 9 aligned with Chapter 6

# Export the book as cognitive artifact
cognition-cli export lattice-book.cogx
```

**The manual documents itself using the system it describes.**
