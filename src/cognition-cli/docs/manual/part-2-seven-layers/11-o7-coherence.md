## 1. Executive Summary

The **Strategic Coherence Overlay** (O₇) is the synthesis layer that verifies alignment between code (O₁), mission (O₄), and all other overlays. It answers the fundamental question:

**"Does our code embody our mission?"**

### Key Properties

**Pure Mathematics**: No LLM required—coherence is computed via cosine similarity between embeddings (O₁ structural patterns vs O₄ mission concepts).

**Cross-Layer Synthesis**: Uses O₁ (structure), O₃ (lineage), O₄ (mission), O₆ (mathematical properties) to compute alignment.

**Three Coherence Metrics**:

1. **Average**: Simple arithmetic mean (baseline)
2. **Weighted**: Centrality-based weighting (architectural importance)
3. **Lattice**: Gaussian + centrality synthesis (signal amplification, noise filtering)

**Drift Detection**: Identifies symbols with low alignment scores (< 0.5) and mission concepts with no implementing code.

### Why Coherence Matters

**Without O₇**: You can have perfect code (O₁), comprehensive security (O₂), complete lineage (O₃), clear mission (O₄), operational guidance (O₅), and formal proofs (O₆)—but **no way to verify they align**.

**With O₇**: You can answer:

- "Which functions are most aligned with mission?"
- "Which code has drifted from strategic intent?"
- "What implements the 'verifiable AI' concept?"
- "Show me coherence report for this PR"
- "What's the lattice coherence after filtering statistical noise?"

---

## 2. The Synthesis Layer

O₇ Coherence is unique among the seven overlays: **it doesn't extract new knowledge from source code**. Instead, it **synthesizes knowledge across existing overlays** to compute alignment.

### Data Flow

**Analogy**: If the seven overlays are instruments in an orchestra, O₇ Coherence is the conductor ensuring they play in harmony.

## 3. Core Concepts — Alignment, Coherence, Implementation

### Concept 1: Alignment

An **alignment** is a semantic relationship between a code symbol and a mission concept, measured by cosine similarity.

```typescript
interface ConceptAlignment {
  conceptText: string; // Mission concept
  conceptSection: string; // Vision, Mission, Principles, etc.
  alignmentScore: number; // Cosine similarity (0.0 - 1.0)
  sectionHash: string; // Provenance to O₄
}
```

**Example**:

```json
{
  "conceptText": "Cryptographic truth is essential",
  "conceptSection": "Principles",
  "alignmentScore": 0.87,
  "sectionHash": "sha256:abc123..."
}
```

**Interpretation**:

- 0.87 = **High alignment** (strong semantic relationship)
- The function `calculateHash()` embodies the principle "Cryptographic truth is essential"

### Concept 2: Symbol Coherence

The **coherence** of a code symbol is its overall alignment with mission concepts, computed from its top N alignments.

```typescript
interface SymbolCoherence {
  symbolName: string; // e.g., "ConceptExtractor"
  filePath: string; // e.g., "src/core/analyzers/..."
  symbolHash: string; // Link to O₁
  topAlignments: ConceptAlignment[]; // Top N mission concepts
  overallCoherence: number; // Average of top alignments
}
```

**Example**:

```yaml
symbolName: 'ConceptExtractor'
filePath: 'src/core/analyzers/concept-extractor.ts'
symbolHash: 'sha256:abc123...'
topAlignments:
  - conceptText: 'Pattern-based extraction targets structural markers'
    conceptSection: 'Patterns'
    alignmentScore: 0.91
  - conceptText: 'The code is docs, the docs is code'
    conceptSection: 'Meta'
    alignmentScore: 0.84
overallCoherence: 0.875 # Average of [0.91, 0.84]
```

**Interpretation**:

- Overall coherence: **0.875** (excellent)
- Top alignment: Pattern-based extraction (0.91)
- This symbol strongly embodies its mission

### Concept 3: Concept Implementation

The **reverse mapping**: which code symbols implement each mission concept.

```typescript
interface ConceptImplementation {
  conceptText: string;
  conceptSection: string;
  implementingSymbols: {
    symbolName: string;
    filePath: string;
    alignmentScore: number;
  }[];
}
```

**Example**:

```yaml
conceptText: 'Cryptographic truth is essential'
conceptSection: 'Principles'
implementingSymbols:
  - symbolName: 'calculateStructuralHash'
    filePath: 'src/core/pgc/hashing.ts'
    alignmentScore: 0.89
  - symbolName: 'ObjectStore'
    filePath: 'src/core/pgc/object-store.ts'
    alignmentScore: 0.82
```

**Use Case**: "Show me all code that implements 'Cryptographic truth is essential'"

**Result**: Two functions with alignment scores > 0.8.

---

## 4. Coherence Metrics — Three Weighting Strategies

O₇ computes **three coherence metrics** with different philosophies:

### Metric 1: Average Coherence (Baseline)

**Formula**: Simple arithmetic mean

```
average_coherence = Σ(alignment_score) / n
```

**Philosophy**: All symbols are equal.

**Use Case**: Quick baseline measure.

**Example**:

```
Symbol A: 0.9
Symbol B: 0.8
Symbol C: 0.7
Symbol D: 0.1  (outlier)

average = (0.9 + 0.8 + 0.7 + 0.1) / 4 = 0.625
```

**Limitation**: Outliers heavily influence the metric (Symbol D drags down average).

### Metric 2: Weighted Coherence (Centrality-Based)

**Formula**: Weighted by architectural importance (dependency count from O₃)

```
weight(symbol) = log₁₀(dependency_count + 1)
weighted_coherence = Σ(alignment_score × weight) / Σ(weight)
```

**Philosophy**: Core infrastructure matters more than leaf nodes.

**Use Case**: Emphasize symbols that are widely depended upon.

**Example**:

```
Symbol A: alignment=0.9, deps=100 → weight=log₁₀(101)≈2.0 → contribution=1.8
Symbol B: alignment=0.8, deps=10  → weight=log₁₀(11)≈1.0  → contribution=0.8
Symbol C: alignment=0.7, deps=5   → weight=log₁₀(6)≈0.78  → contribution=0.55
Symbol D: alignment=0.1, deps=1   → weight=log₁₀(2)≈0.3   → contribution=0.03

weighted = (1.8 + 0.8 + 0.55 + 0.03) / (2.0 + 1.0 + 0.78 + 0.3) = 0.77
```

**Benefit**: High-centrality symbols (like Symbol A) dominate the metric.

### Metric 3: Lattice Coherence (Gaussian + Centrality)

**Formula**: Synthesizes Gaussian statistics + centrality weighting

```
z_score = (alignment_score - μ) / σ
gaussian_weight = max(0.1, 1.0 + z_score)
lattice_weight = centrality × gaussian_weight
lattice_coherence = Σ(alignment × lattice_weight) / Σ(lattice_weight)
```

**Philosophy**: Signal amplification + noise filtering across overlays.

**Key Properties**:

- ✅ **No hardcoded constants**: All weights derived from data (μ, σ from alignment distribution)
- ✅ **Noise filtering**: Symbols below μ - σ are excluded (z_score < -1)
- ✅ **Signal amplification**: High-centrality + high-alignment symbols dominate
- ✅ **Cross-overlay synthesis**: Uses O₁ (structure), O₃ (lineage), O₄ (mission)

**Example**:

```
Distribution: μ = 0.6, σ = 0.2

Symbol A: alignment=0.9, deps=100
  z_score = (0.9 - 0.6) / 0.2 = 1.5
  gaussian_weight = 1.0 + 1.5 = 2.5
  centrality = log₁₀(101) = 2.0
  lattice_weight = 2.5 × 2.0 = 5.0
  contribution = 0.9 × 5.0 = 4.5

Symbol D: alignment=0.1, deps=1
  z_score = (0.1 - 0.6) / 0.2 = -2.5
  gaussian_weight = max(0.1, 1.0 + (-2.5)) = 0.1  (noise filter applied)
  centrality = log₁₀(2) = 0.3
  lattice_weight = 0.1 × 0.3 = 0.03
  contribution = 0.1 × 0.03 = 0.003
```

**Result**: Symbol A has **1500x** more influence than Symbol D (4.5 / 0.003).

**This is the most sophisticated metric and represents true lattice coherence.**

---

## 5. Lattice-Aware Weighting — Gaussian + Centrality

**Monument 5.1**: The lattice coherence metric represents a **fundamental shift** from simple averaging to **statistical synthesis across overlays**.

### Why Gaussian Weighting?

**Problem**: Simple averaging treats all symbols equally, amplifying noise from low-quality alignments.

**Solution**: Use Gaussian statistics (z-scores) to separate signal from noise.

**Z-Score Formula**:

```
z_score = (alignment_score - μ) / σ

Where:
  μ = mean alignment score across all symbols
  σ = standard deviation of alignment scores
```

**Interpretation**:

| Z-Score  | Meaning             | Action             |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| > +2     | Very high alignment | Strong signal      |
| +1 to +2 | Above average       | Signal             |
| -1 to +1 | Within normal range | Neutral            |
| -1 to -2 | Below average       | Weak signal        |
| < -2     | Very low alignment  | Noise (filter out) |

**Gaussian Weight**:

```
gaussian_weight = max(0.1, 1.0 + z_score)

Examples:
  z = +2.0 → weight = 3.0 (3x influence)
  z = +1.0 → weight = 2.0 (2x influence)
  z =  0.0 → weight = 1.0 (baseline)
  z = -1.0 → weight = 0.1 (filtered)
  z = -2.0 → weight = 0.1 (filtered)
```

**Key Property**: `max(0.1, ...)` ensures no symbol is completely excluded, but low-scoring symbols have minimal influence.

### Why Centrality Weighting?

**Problem**: Leaf nodes and core infrastructure have different importance.

**Solution**: Weight by dependency count (from O₃ lineage).

**Centrality Formula**:

```
centrality = log₁₀(dependency_count + 1)
```

**Interpretation**:

| Dependencies | Centrality | Meaning                   |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| 0            | 0.0        | Leaf node (no dependents) |
| 1            | 0.3        | Low centrality            |
| 10           | 1.0        | Moderate centrality       |
| 100          | 2.0        | High centrality           |
| 1000         | 3.0        | Very high centrality      |

**Why Logarithmic?**: Linear weighting would give too much influence to heavily-used symbols. Log scaling ensures balanced weighting.

### Combined Lattice Weight

**Formula**:

```
lattice_weight = centrality × gaussian_weight
```

**Example 1: High-Centrality, High-Alignment Symbol**

```
Symbol: UserService
Alignment: 0.85 (z_score = +1.5, assuming μ=0.6, σ=0.2)
Dependencies: 50

gaussian_weight = 1.0 + 1.5 = 2.5
centrality = log₁₀(51) = 1.7
lattice_weight = 2.5 × 1.7 = 4.25
```

**Interpretation**: This symbol has **4.25x** influence on lattice coherence.

**Example 2: High-Centrality, Low-Alignment Symbol**

```
Symbol: LegacyUtility
Alignment: 0.3 (z_score = -1.5, assuming μ=0.6, σ=0.2)
Dependencies: 100

gaussian_weight = max(0.1, 1.0 + (-1.5)) = 0.1  (filtered!)
centrality = log₁₀(101) = 2.0
lattice_weight = 0.1 × 2.0 = 0.2
```

**Interpretation**: Despite high centrality, low alignment score filters out this symbol (only **0.2x** influence). **This is drift detection in action.**

**Example 3: Low-Centrality, High-Alignment Symbol**

```
Symbol: NewFeature
Alignment: 0.9 (z_score = +2.0, assuming μ=0.6, σ=0.2)
Dependencies: 1

gaussian_weight = 1.0 + 2.0 = 3.0
centrality = log₁₀(2) = 0.3
lattice_weight = 3.0 × 0.3 = 0.9
```

**Interpretation**: Despite low centrality, high alignment gives moderate influence (0.9x).

### Final Lattice Coherence Computation

```
lattice_coherence = Σ(alignment_score × lattice_weight) / Σ(lattice_weight)
```

**Property**: This is a **weighted average** where weights are derived entirely from the lattice structure (no hardcoded constants).

**Key Insight**: Lattice coherence is not just a metric—it's a **formal measurement of how well the codebase embodies the mission**, filtered through the lens of architectural importance and statistical significance.

## 7. Cosine Similarity Algorithm

The core alignment computation uses **cosine similarity** between 768-dimensional embedding vectors.

### Mathematical Definition

```
cosine_similarity(A, B) = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)

Where:
  A · B = Σ(Aᵢ × Bᵢ)           (dot product)
  ||A|| = √(Σ(Aᵢ²))            (magnitude of A)
  ||B|| = √(Σ(Bᵢ²))            (magnitude of B)
```

### Geometric Interpretation

Cosine similarity measures the **angle** between two vectors:

```
cos(θ) = similarity

θ = 0°   → similarity = 1.0  (perfect alignment)
θ = 45°  → similarity = 0.7  (high alignment)
θ = 60°  → similarity = 0.5  (moderate alignment)
θ = 90°  → similarity = 0.0  (orthogonal, no alignment)
```

### Range and Interpretation

**Range**: -1.0 to +1.0 (typically 0.0 to 1.0 for embeddings)

**Interpretation**:

| Score     | Meaning             | Action                       |
| --------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 0.9 - 1.0 | Perfect alignment   | Excellent mission embodiment |
| 0.7 - 0.9 | High alignment      | Strong relationship          |
| 0.5 - 0.7 | Moderate alignment  | Acceptable but review        |
| 0.3 - 0.5 | Weak alignment      | Potential drift              |
| 0.0 - 0.3 | Very weak alignment | Investigate or refactor      |

### Implementation (TypeScript)

```typescript
function cosineSimilarity(vecA: number[], vecB: number[]): number {
  if (vecA.length !== vecB.length) {
    throw new Error(
      `Vector dimension mismatch: ${vecA.length} vs ${vecB.length}`
    );
  }

  let dotProduct = 0;
  let normA = 0;
  let normB = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < vecA.length; i++) {
    dotProduct += vecA[i] * vecB[i];
    normA += vecA[i] * vecA[i];
    normB += vecB[i] * vecB[i];
  }

  normA = Math.sqrt(normA);
  normB = Math.sqrt(normB);

  if (normA === 0 || normB === 0) {
    return 0; // Avoid division by zero
  }

  return dotProduct / (normA * normB);
}
```

### Complexity

**Time Complexity**: O(D) where D = embedding dimension (768)

**Space Complexity**: O(1) (in-place computation)

**Total Comparisons**: For N symbols and M concepts:

- Naive: O(N × M × D) = O(N × M × 768)
- With LanceDB ANN indexing: O(N × log M × D)

---

## 8. Drift Detection and Remediation

### What is Drift?

**Drift** occurs when code symbols have low alignment with mission concepts. This can happen when:

1. **Code evolves** without mission updates (feature creep)
2. **Mission evolves** without code refactoring (strategic pivot)
3. **Legacy code** remains from previous architectures

### High Drift Indicators

1. **Low Alignment Score**: Symbol coherence < 0.5
2. **No Top-3 Mission Concepts**: All alignments below threshold
3. **High Centrality + Low Coherence**: Important symbol but misaligned (critical drift)

### Example: Drifted Symbol

```yaml
symbolName: 'LegacyDataProcessor'
filePath: 'src/legacy/data-processor.ts'
symbolHash: 'sha256:legacy_xyz...'
topAlignments:
  - conceptText: 'Real-time processing'
    conceptSection: 'Vision'
    alignmentScore: 0.42 # LOW!
  - conceptText: 'Data integrity'
    conceptSection: 'Principles'
    alignmentScore: 0.38 # LOW!
overallCoherence: 0.40 # DRIFT DETECTED!
```

**Interpretation**: This symbol has **drifted** from mission (coherence < 0.5).

### Remediation Strategies

**For Drifted Symbols**:

1. **Refactor**: Align implementation with mission

   ```bash
   # Identify drift
   cognition-cli coherence drifted --sort-by centrality

   # Refactor high-centrality symbols first
   ```

2. **Document**: Explain how it supports mission

   ```typescript
   /**
    * Mission Alignment: "Data integrity" (Principles)
    * Despite low semantic similarity, this module validates
    * all incoming data against schema before processing.
    */
   ```

3. **Remove**: If truly misaligned with vision
   ```bash
   # If symbol doesn't serve mission, deprecate it
   git rm src/legacy/data-processor.ts
   ```

**For Concept Gaps**:

Mission concepts with no implementing code indicate **unimplemented vision**.

```yaml
conceptText: 'Real-time collaboration'
conceptSection: 'Vision'
implementingSymbols: [] # NO IMPLEMENTATION!
```

**Remediation**:

1. **Implement**: Build missing functionality
2. **Revise Mission**: Remove concept if no longer relevant

  - ObjectStore → "Content-addressable storage" (0.85)

✓ Security layer strongly embodies mission principles.
```

### Use Case 5: Feature Validation

**Question**: "Does this new feature align with our vision?"

```bash
# After implementing feature
cognition-cli coherence check --path src/features/new-feature
```

**Output**:

```
Feature Coherence: src/features/new-feature
============================================
Overall Coherence: 0.82 (GOOD)
Top Alignments:
  - NewFeatureManager → "Real-time processing" (0.88)
  - FeatureConfig → "Extensible architecture" (0.79)

✓ Feature aligns well with mission.
```

### Use Case 6: Mission Evolution

**Question**: "If we update our mission, what code needs to change?"

```bash
# Generate coherence with new mission docs
cognition-cli coherence generate --docs VISION_v2.md

# Compare before/after
cognition-cli coherence diff baseline.yaml current.yaml
```

**Output**:

```
Coherence Diff: baseline.yaml → current.yaml
=============================================
Lattice Coherence: 0.81 → 0.73 (-0.08) ⚠
Aligned Symbols: 47 → 42 (-5) ⚠
Drifted Symbols: 8 → 13 (+5) ⚠

Newly Drifted Symbols:
  - UserService (0.78 → 0.45) - CRITICAL DRIFT
  - AuthManager (0.72 → 0.48) - DRIFT

Recommendation: REVIEW
Mission update has caused significant drift. Review and refactor.
```

## 10. Cross-Overlay Integration

O₇ Coherence is the **only overlay** that depends on all other overlays. It synthesizes knowledge across the entire lattice.

### Uses O₁ (Structure)

**What**: Structural pattern embeddings (code symbols)

**How**: Load symbol embeddings from O₁ vector store

```typescript
// From O₁ structural_patterns overlay
const structuralItems = await vectorStore.getAllItems('structural_patterns');

for (const item of structuralItems) {
  const symbolEmbedding = item.vector; // 768-dim vector
  // Compute alignment with mission concepts...
}
```

### Uses O₃ (Lineage)

**What**: Dependency graph (reverse_deps counts)

**How**: Load dependency counts for centrality weighting

```typescript
// From O₃ lineage overlay
const lineageData = await loadLineageOverlay(pgcRoot);

for (const symbol of lineageData.symbols) {
  const dependencyCount = symbol.reverse_deps?.length || 0;
  const centrality = Math.log10(dependencyCount + 1);
  // Use centrality in lattice weighting...
}
```

### Uses O₄ (Mission)

**What**: Mission concept embeddings (strategic anchors)

**How**: Load concept embeddings from O₄ vector store

```typescript
// From O₄ mission_concepts overlay
const missionItems = await vectorStore.getAllItems('mission_concepts');

for (const item of missionItems) {
  const conceptEmbedding = item.vector; // 768-dim vector
  // Compute alignment with code symbols...
}
```

### Uses O₂ (Security)

**What**: Security guideline concepts

**How**: Validate security layer alignment with mission

```typescript
// Query: "Does security implementation honor 'cryptographic truth'?"
const securitySymbols = await filterSymbolsByPath('src/core/security');
const cryptoMissionConcept = await getMissionConcept(
  'Cryptographic truth is essential'
);

const alignmentScore = cosineSimilarity(
  securitySymbols[0].embedding,
  cryptoMissionConcept.embedding
);

if (alignmentScore < 0.7) {
  console.warn('⚠ Security implementation misaligned with mission');
}
```

### Uses O₅ (Operational)

**What**: Operational workflow concepts

**How**: Validate workflows honor mission principles

```typescript
// Query: "Do operational flows honor 'validate before trust'?"
const operationalSymbols = await filterSymbolsByPath('src/workflows');
const validateMissionConcept = await getMissionConcept('Validate before trust');

const alignmentScore = cosineSimilarity(
  operationalSymbols[0].embedding,
  validateMissionConcept.embedding
);
```

### Uses O₆ (Mathematical)

**What**: Formal proofs and theorems

**How**: Validate mathematical properties ground mission principles

```typescript
// Query: "Do mathematical proofs ground 'mathematical certainty'?"
const mathSymbols = await filterSymbolsByPath('src/core/proofs');
const certaintyMissionConcept = await getMissionConcept(
  'Mathematical certainty'
);

const alignmentScore = cosineSimilarity(
  mathSymbols[0].embedding,
  certaintyMissionConcept.embedding
);
```

### Validation Across All Layers

**O₇ Coherence validates that all overlays align with mission**:

```
O₁ (Structure)    → "Does code structure honor mission?"
O₂ (Security)     → "Do security measures honor mission?"
O₃ (Lineage)      → "Does dependency graph honor mission?"
O₄ (Mission)      → "Is mission internally coherent?"
O₅ (Operational)  → "Do workflows honor mission?"
O₆ (Mathematical) → "Do proofs ground mission claims?"
```

**This is the lattice in action**: All layers are **queryable**, **composable**, and **verifiable** through O₇ Coherence.

## Summary

O₇ Coherence is the **synthesis layer** that answers the fundamental question: **"Does our code embody our mission?"**

**Key Components**:

1. **Alignment**: Cosine similarity between code symbols and mission concepts
2. **Symbol Coherence**: Per-symbol alignment metrics
3. **Concept Implementation**: Reverse mapping (concept → symbols)
4. **Three Coherence Metrics**: Average, weighted, lattice
5. **Lattice-Aware Weighting**: Gaussian + centrality synthesis
6. **Drift Detection**: Identify misaligned symbols and concept gaps

**Cross-Overlay Integration**:

- Uses O₁ (structure), O₃ (lineage), O₄ (mission)
- Validates O₂ (security), O₅ (operational), O₆ (mathematical)

**Use Cases**:

- Architecture review
- Refactoring guidance
- Feature validation
- Mission evolution impact analysis

**CLI Commands**:

- `coherence check` - Overall coherence report
- `coherence drifted` - Find misaligned symbols
- `coherence gaps` - Find unimplemented concepts
- `coherence diff` - Compare coherence over time

**Monument 5.1**: Lattice coherence represents a **fundamental shift** from simple metrics to **statistical synthesis across overlays**, with no hardcoded constants—all weights derived from the lattice structure itself.
