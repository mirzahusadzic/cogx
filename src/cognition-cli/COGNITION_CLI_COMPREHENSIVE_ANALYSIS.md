## 1. What Is This Project?

### Core Concept

Cognition CLI transforms unstructured source code into a **rich, queryable, and verifiably-grounded knowledge graph**. The problem it solves is fundamental:

**The Core Problem:** Modern LLMs are powerful pattern-matchers but lack deep, verifiable understanding of project architecture. They:

- Generate high-confidence hallucinations (plausible but architecturally unsound code)
- Suggest broken refactorings that break distant, unseen dependencies
- Cannot reason about system-level impact of changes
- Operate with limited context windows and no understanding of the intricate dependency lattice

### The Solution

The Cognition CLI creates a persistent "digital brain" for your project — the **Grounded Context Pool (PGC)** — stored in a `.open_cognition` directory. This is a content-addressable, immutable knowledge structure that:

- Provides cryptographically-verified, auditable facts about your codebase
- Enables AI agents to reason about code with genuine architectural awareness
- Creates a reflexive nervous system that detects changes and heals itself
- Implements the Goal → Transform → Oracle cycle for trustworthy knowledge

### Core Philosophy

The project embodies the principle of **verifiable symbiotic AI**: partnering human architects with AI agents that can be trusted because they're grounded in cryptographic truth, not just statistical approximation.

## 2. Architecture and Main Components

### The Four Pillars of the PGC

The knowledge graph is built on four fundamental pillars, all stored in `.open_cognition/`:

#### **1. Object Store** (`objects/`)

- **Role:** The Immutable Memory
- **Mechanism:** Content-addressable storage (like Git's) using SHA-256 hashes
- **Purpose:** Stores every unique piece of knowledge (code, ASTs, structural data)
- **Property:** Cannot be altered — immutable and deduplicated

#### **2. Transform Log** (`transforms/`)

- **Role:** The Auditable Thought Process
- **Mechanism:** Immutable, append-only log of every operation
- **Purpose:** Records how knowledge was created and transformed
- **Property:** Perfect, verifiable history of derivations

#### **3. Index** (`index/`)

- **Role:** The Conscious Mind / Table of Contents
- **Mechanism:** Human-readable mapping from file paths to content hashes
- **Purpose:** Fast lookup of current, valid content in the Object Store
- **Property:** Always points to current, verified state

#### **4. Reverse Dependencies** (`reverse_deps/`)

- **Role:** The Reflexive Nervous System
- **Mechanism:** O(1) reverse-lookup index
- **Purpose:** Enable instantaneous dependency traversal and impact analysis
- **Property:** Enables "blast radius" calculations

### Supporting Faculties

#### **LanceVectorStore** (Semantic Intelligence)

- Uses **LanceDB**, an embedded high-performance vector database
- Stores 768-dimensional vector embeddings of code patterns
- Enables structural similarity searches beyond exact matching
- Allows finding architecturally similar components across the codebase

#### **Overlays** (Layered Understanding)

Seven specialized analytical layers that enrich the core knowledge graph:

| Overlay              | Identifier | Purpose                     | Content                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Structural Patterns  | O₁         | Code artifacts & structure  | Function/class embeddings, architectural roles |
| Security Guidelines  | O₂         | Threat models & mitigations | Attack vectors, CVEs, vulnerabilities          |
| Lineage Patterns     | O₃         | Dependency tracking         | Import relationships, call chains              |
| Mission Concepts     | O₄         | Strategic concepts          | Principles, values, mission alignment          |
| Operational Patterns | O₅         | Workflow patterns           | Processes, quests, sacred sequences            |
| Mathematical Proofs  | O₆         | Formal verification         | Theorems, lemmas, axioms                       |
| Strategic Coherence  | O₇         | Cross-layer synthesis       | Alignment metrics, drift detection             |

## 5. Unique and Interesting Aspects

### 1. **Cryptographic Grounding**

The system uses **content-addressable storage with SHA-256 hashing** to ensure:

- Every piece of knowledge is cryptographically verified
- Impossible to silently corrupt data (hash verification fails)
- Perfect provenance trails (complete chain of derivation)
- "Did this happen?" becomes mathematically answerable

### 2. **The Fidelity Labeling System**

Every extracted piece of knowledge includes a `fidelity` score:

- **1.0 (Cryptographic Truth):** Deterministic AST parsing
- **0.85 (High Confidence):** Specialized Language Model
- **0.70 (Educated Guess):** General LLM fallback

This transparency about uncertainty is fundamental to verifiable AI.

### 3. **Multi-Layer Mining Strategy**

Three-layer waterfall approach ensures maximum verifiability:

1. Try deterministic AST parsing first
2. Fall back to specialized SLM
3. Use general LLM as last resort

Each layer is traceable and labeled with fidelity.

### 4. **The Lattice Algebra System**

A complete Boolean algebra implementation across 7 overlays enabling:

- Set operations: `O1 ∩ O2` (intersection), `O1 ∪ O2` (union)
- Tag filtering: `O2[critical]`, `O4[mission-alignment]`
- Semantic search: `O4 ~ "verification"`
- Query composition: Complex multi-overlay reasoning

This is "SQL for your codebase's semantic structure."

### 5. **Self-Aware Architecture**

The system is capable of analyzing itself:

- **AI-Grounded Architecture Analysis** document generated by running cognition-cli on itself
- Zero hallucinations — every claim backed by PGC data
- 100% reproducible analysis
- Meta-cognitive loop: cognition-cli analyzing itself using its own tools

### 6. **Security-First Design**

Includes comprehensive security overlays:

- **Dual-Use Mandate** documentation acknowledging weaponization risks
- **Mission Integrity Validation** prevents malicious mission injection
- **Security Coherence Metrics** track alignment with security principles
- **Drift Detection** for identifying security-relevant deviations

Explicit acknowledgment that the system could be weaponized for ideological conformity enforcement — and recommends safeguards.

### 7. **Cognitive Prosthetics Vision**

Extends to human memory preservation:

- Same architecture that understands code can preserve human memory
- Content-addressable memories with cryptographic verification
- Protection against false memories
- Application to dementia, Alzheimer's, traumatic brain injury treatment

### 8. **Monument Pattern**

Event-driven, self-healing architecture:

- Watch detects changes
- Status checks coherence in < 10ms
- Update heals incrementally
- Complete feedback loop for real-time synchronization

### 9. **Comprehensive Documentation**

- 25+ markdown documents covering every aspect
- 900+ pages of "Foundation Manual"
- Architecture specifications (CPOW, Multi-Overlay)
- Guides for each command
- Research papers and theoretical foundations

### 10. **First Human-AI Grounded Collaboration**

### Key Characteristics

- **Total Objects:** 155 unique content-addressed pieces of knowledge
- **Total Transforms:** 84 immutable operation records
- **Total Index Entries:** 102 file mappings
- **Total Reverse Deps:** 143 dependency reverse-lookup entries
- **Vector DB:** 8 LanceDB index files for semantic search
- **Overlays:** Multiple YAML/JSON layers for specialized analysis
- **Total Size:** Efficiently compressed due to content deduplication

### How It Works

1. **When you run `genesis`:**
   - StructuralMiner parses source files → creates StructuralData objects
   - Each piece of data is hashed → stored in `objects/`
   - Hash recorded in `index/` with file path
   - Transform recorded in `transforms/` (audit trail)
   - Dependencies analyzed → `reverse_deps/` updated

2. **When you run `watch` + `status` + `update`:**
   - Watch detects file changes → `dirty_state.json`
   - Status reads dirty_state → < 10ms coherence check
   - Update re-parses changed files → new objects/transforms
   - Index updated → dirty state cleared

3. **When you generate overlays:**
   - Overlay generators read core knowledge
   - Create specialized embeddings and metadata
   - Store in overlay-specific directories
   - Register in LanceDB for vector similarity

- Recommends safeguards (mission integrity validation)

#### **5. Layered Extraction**

- Deterministic methods first (AST parsing)
- Specialized models second (SLM)
- General models last resort (LLM)
- Each layer labeled with confidence

#### **6. Composable Overlays**

- 7 cognitive dimensions (O₁-O₇)
- Each independent but interconnected
- Boolean algebra across layers
- Extensible for new domain-specific overlays

#### **7. Reflexive Self-Healing**

- Monument pattern enables continuous synchronization
- Detects its own incoherence (status check)
- Heals itself incrementally (update)
- No human intervention required for steady state

### Research & Vision

The project serves as a research platform for:

- **Verifiable AI Code Assistance:** Grounding AI responses in cryptographic truth
- **Architectural Reasoning:** Enabling AI reasoning about code at system-wide levels
- **Cognitive Prosthetics:** Extending to human memory preservation
- **Mission-Driven Development:** Aligning code with stated principles
- **Formal Verification:** Mathematical proofs for correctness

### The Promise

> "When biological memory fails, verifiable external memory can preserve identity, consciousness, and human dignity."

The same architecture that understands code can preserve human identity through memory loss. This vision extends beyond software development into healthcare and human preservation.
