## 1. What Is This Project?

### Core Concept

Cognition CLI transforms unstructured source code into a **rich, queryable, and verifiably-grounded knowledge graph**. The problem it solves is fundamental:

**The Core Problem:** Modern LLMs are powerful pattern-matchers but lack deep, verifiable understanding of project architecture. They:

- Generate high-confidence hallucinations (plausible but architecturally unsound code)
- Suggest broken refactorings that break distant, unseen dependencies
- Cannot reason about system-level impact of changes
- Operate with limited context windows and no understanding of the intricate dependency lattice

### The Solution

The Cognition CLI creates a persistent "digital brain" for your project — the **Grounded Context Pool (PGC)** — stored in a `.open_cognition` directory. This is a content-addressable, immutable knowledge structure that:

- Provides cryptographically-verified, auditable facts about your codebase
- Enables AI agents to reason about code with genuine architectural awareness
- Creates a reflexive nervous system that detects changes and heals itself
- Implements the Goal → Transform → Oracle cycle for trustworthy knowledge

### Core Philosophy

The project embodies the principle of **verifiable symbiotic AI**: partnering human architects with AI agents that can be trusted because they're grounded in cryptographic truth, not just statistical approximation.

## 2. Architecture and Main Components

### The Four Pillars of the PGC

The knowledge graph is built on four fundamental pillars, all stored in `.open_cognition/`:

#### **1. Object Store** (`objects/`)

- **Role:** The Immutable Memory
- **Mechanism:** Content-addressable storage (like Git's) using SHA-256 hashes
- **Purpose:** Stores every unique piece of knowledge (code, ASTs, structural data)
- **Property:** Cannot be altered — immutable and deduplicated

#### **2. Transform Log** (`transforms/`)

- **Role:** The Auditable Thought Process
- **Mechanism:** Immutable, append-only log of every operation
- **Purpose:** Records how knowledge was created and transformed
- **Property:** Perfect, verifiable history of derivations

#### **3. Index** (`index/`)

- **Role:** The Conscious Mind / Table of Contents
- **Mechanism:** Human-readable mapping from file paths to content hashes
- **Purpose:** Fast lookup of current, valid content in the Object Store
- **Property:** Always points to current, verified state

#### **4. Reverse Dependencies** (`reverse_deps/`)

- **Role:** The Reflexive Nervous System
- **Mechanism:** O(1) reverse-lookup index
- **Purpose:** Enable instantaneous dependency traversal and impact analysis
- **Property:** Enables "blast radius" calculations

### The Sigma Dual-Lattice Architecture (v2.0.0)

**Innovation #39-46** — The breakthrough that enables **infinite context** for AI conversations.

While the PGC (`.open_cognition/`) provides a lattice for **project knowledge**, Sigma adds a parallel lattice for **conversation knowledge** (`.sigma/`). These two lattices work together through **Meet (∧)** operations to create true infinite context.

#### **The Dual Lattice**

```
Project Lattice (PGC)          Conversation Lattice (Sigma)
.open_cognition/          ∧    .sigma/
├── objects/                   ├── objects/          (conversation turns)
├── transforms/                ├── overlays/
├── index/                     │   ├── O1/           (structural patterns)
├── reverse_deps/              │   ├── O2/           (security discussions)
└── overlays/ (O₁-O₇)          │   ├── O3/           (conversational flow)
                               │   ├── O4/           (mission concepts)
                               │   ├── O5/           (operational patterns)
                               │   ├── O6/           (mathematical concepts)
                               │   └── O7/           (coherence scores)
                               └── index/            (conversation state)
```

#### **How Sigma Solves the Context Window Problem**

**The Problem with Standard LLM Sessions:**

- Compression is lossy
- No true memory across sessions

**Sigma's Solution:**

1. **Proactive Compression**
   - Uses intelligent importance formula: `novelty × 5 + max(alignment_O1..O7) × 0.5`
   - Preserves high-signal turns, discards noise

2. **Fresh Start at <20K**
   - Gives larger usable runway per session

3. **Session Lifecycle Management**

   ```
   Session N: 0K → 140K → INTELLIGENT COMPRESSION
                             ↓
   Session N+1: <10K → 140K → COMPRESSION
                                ↓
   Session N+2: <10K → ... (infinite chain)
   ```

4. **High-Fidelity Memory Recall**
   - Specialized persona with temporal re-ranking
   - Multi-overlay search across O₁-O₇
   - 5-retry exponential backoff for API errors
   - Preserves technical details (file names, function names, decisions)

5. **Real-Time Conversation Indexing**
   - Every turn indexed across 7 dimensions (O₁-O₇)
   - Novelty scoring for each turn
   - Importance calculation for compression decisions
   - Lattice statistics (nodes, edges, shifts)

6. **Periodic Overlay Persistence**
   - Auto-flush every 5 turns
   - Cleanup on exit preventing data loss
   - Overlays remain in memory across SDK sessions

7. **Session Forwarding**
   - Automatic chain management via `.sigma/{id}.state.json`
   - User always uses original session ID
   - Sigma manages internal session resurrection

#### **The Interactive TUI**

Sigma includes a production-ready terminal user interface built with **Ink** (React for terminals):

**Features:**

- ✅ **Live Lattice Visualization** — Real-time overlay counts (O1-O7)
- ✅ **Token Tracking** — Exact count with compression threshold
- ✅ **Lattice Statistics** — Nodes, edges, context shifts
- ✅ **Importance Scoring** — Novelty + alignment per turn
- ✅ **Toggle Info Panel** — Detailed overlay breakdown
- ✅ **Scroll History** — Navigate previous messages
- ✅ **Persistent UI State** — Resume where you left off

**Why the TUI Matters:**

The TUI provides **radical transparency**:

- See exactly how many tokens you're using
- Watch the lattice grow in real-time as you chat
- Understand which overlays are being activated
- Know when compression will trigger
- Trust the system through visibility

**Example TUI Output:**

```
Tokens: 57.5K / 150K
Lattice: 10 nodes, 9 edges, 1 shift
Novelty: 0.53 | Importance: 5.2
O₁: 0.0  O₂: 3.4  O₃: 3.2  O₄: 0.0  O₅: 5.0  O₆: —  O₇: —
```

## 5. Unique and Interesting Aspects

### 1. **Cryptographic Grounding**

The system uses **content-addressable storage with SHA-256 hashing** to ensure:

- Every piece of knowledge is cryptographically verified
- Impossible to silently corrupt data (hash verification fails)
- Perfect provenance trails (complete chain of derivation)
- "Did this happen?" becomes mathematically answerable

### 2. **The Fidelity Labeling System**

Every extracted piece of knowledge includes a `fidelity` score:

- **1.0 (Cryptographic Truth):** Deterministic AST parsing
- **0.85 (High Confidence):** Specialized Language Model
- **0.70 (Educated Guess):** General LLM fallback

This transparency about uncertainty is fundamental to verifiable AI.

### 3. **Multi-Layer Mining Strategy**

Three-layer waterfall approach ensures maximum verifiability:

1. Try deterministic AST parsing first
2. Fall back to specialized SLM
3. Use general LLM as last resort

Each layer is traceable and labeled with fidelity.

### 4. **The Lattice Algebra System**

A complete Boolean algebra implementation across 7 overlays enabling:

- Set operations: `O1 ∩ O2` (intersection), `O1 ∪ O2` (union)
- Tag filtering: `O2[critical]`, `O4[mission-alignment]`
- Semantic search: `O4 ~ "verification"`
- Query composition: Complex multi-overlay reasoning

This is "SQL for your codebase's semantic structure."

### 5. **Self-Aware Architecture**

The system is capable of analyzing itself:

- **AI-Grounded Architecture Analysis** document generated by running cognition-cli on itself
- Zero hallucinations — every claim backed by PGC data
- 100% reproducible analysis
- Meta-cognitive loop: cognition-cli analyzing itself using its own tools

### 6. **Security-First Design**

Includes comprehensive security overlays:

- **Dual-Use Mandate** documentation acknowledging weaponization risks
- **Mission Integrity Validation** prevents malicious mission injection
- **Security Coherence Metrics** track alignment with security principles
- **Drift Detection** for identifying security-relevant deviations

Explicit acknowledgment that the system could be weaponized for ideological conformity enforcement — and recommends safeguards.

### 7. **Cognitive Prosthetics Vision**

Extends to human memory preservation:

- Same architecture that understands code can preserve human memory
- Content-addressable memories with cryptographic verification
- Protection against false memories
- Application to dementia, Alzheimer's, traumatic brain injury treatment

### 8. **Monument Pattern**

Event-driven, self-healing architecture:

- Watch detects changes
- Status checks coherence in < 10ms
- Update heals incrementally
- Complete feedback loop for real-time synchronization

### 9. **Sigma: Infinite Context Without Compromise**

**The first LLM wrapper to solve context limits through lattice-based compression:**

- **Proactive Compression**
- **<20K Fresh Starts**
- **~140K Usable Runway** per session
- **Intelligent Preservation** via `novelty × 5 + max(alignment_O1..O7) × 0.5`
- **Multi-Overlay Indexing** of every conversation turn across 7 dimensions
- **Verifiable Memory Recall** with temporal re-ranking and multi-overlay search
- **Session Resurrection** through automatic forwarding chain
- **Radical Transparency** via live TUI

This is **not RAG or summarization** — it's a true dual-lattice architecture where conversation knowledge has the same mathematical rigor as project knowledge.

### 10. **Interactive TUI: Transparency Over Opacity**

Built with **Ink** (React for terminals), the TUI demonstrates radical transparency:

**Real-time Visibility:**

- Exact token count
- Live lattice statistics (nodes, edges, context shifts)
- Per-turn novelty and importance scores
- Overlay activation patterns (O₁-O₇ alignment)
- Compression threshold warnings

**Why It Matters:**

- Users can **trust** what they can **see**
- Catches Anthropic's compression before it happens
- Enables informed decisions about session management
- Proves the lattice is working in real-time

### 11. **Comprehensive Documentation**

- 25+ markdown documents covering every aspect
- 900+ pages of "Foundation Manual"
- Architecture specifications (CPOW, Multi-Overlay)
- Guides for each command
- Research papers and theoretical foundations

### 12. **First Human-AI Grounded Collaboration**

Document: `07_AI_Grounded_Architecture_Analysis.md`

- First architecture analysis generated through pure grounded AI reasoning
- Zero hallucinations — every claim backed by PGC data
- 100% reproducible
- No source files read during analysis — reasoned purely from metadata

### Key Characteristics

- **Total Objects:** 155 unique content-addressed pieces of knowledge
- **Total Transforms:** 84 immutable operation records
- **Total Index Entries:** 102 file mappings
- **Total Reverse Deps:** 143 dependency reverse-lookup entries
- **Vector DB:** 8 LanceDB index files for semantic search
- **Overlays:** Multiple YAML/JSON layers for specialized analysis
- **Total Size:** Efficiently compressed due to content deduplication

### How It Works

1. **When you run `genesis`:**
   - StructuralMiner parses source files → creates StructuralData objects
   - Each piece of data is hashed → stored in `objects/`
   - Hash recorded in `index/` with file path
   - Transform recorded in `transforms/` (audit trail)
   - Dependencies analyzed → `reverse_deps/` updated

2. **When you run `watch` + `status` + `update`:**
   - Watch detects file changes → `dirty_state.json`
   - Status reads dirty_state → < 10ms coherence check
   - Update re-parses changed files → new objects/transforms
   - Index updated → dirty state cleared

3. **When you generate overlays:**
   - Overlay generators read core knowledge
   - Create specialized embeddings and metadata
   - Store in overlay-specific directories
   - Register in LanceDB for vector similarity

## 7. Overall Philosophy and Approach

### Core Tenets

#### **1. Verifiable Truth Over Statistical Approximation**

- Cryptographically grounded (SHA-256 content addressing)
- Immutable audit trails (Transform Log)
- Fidelity labeling for uncertainty
- Zero-trust architecture: everything verified by Oracles

#### **2. Human-AI Symbiosis**

- Humans understand the domain and values
- AI understands structure and patterns
- Together they reason about code with grounded truth
- Partnership, not replacement

#### **3. Radical Transparency**

- All operations logged and auditable
- Every fidelity score explained
- Mission documents and principles explicit
- Drift detection against stated values

#### **4. Dual-Use Awareness**

- System could enforce conformity (for good or ill)
- Acknowledges this explicitly (DUAL_USE_MANDATE.md)
- Users responsible for ethical deployment
- Recommends safeguards (mission integrity validation)

#### **5. Layered Extraction**

- Deterministic methods first (AST parsing)
- Specialized models second (SLM)
- General models last resort (LLM)
- Each layer labeled with confidence

#### **6. Composable Overlays**

- 7 cognitive dimensions (O₁-O₇)
- Each independent but interconnected
- Boolean algebra across layers
- Extensible for new domain-specific overlays

#### **7. Reflexive Self-Healing**

- Monument pattern enables continuous synchronization
- Detects its own incoherence (status check)
- Heals itself incrementally (update)
- No human intervention required for steady state

### Research & Vision

## Conclusion

Cognition CLI is a sophisticated research platform and production tool that reimagines AI-assisted development through verifiable, content-addressed knowledge graphs. **Version 2.1.0** extends this vision from project knowledge to **infinite conversational memory**, solving the context window problem through dual-lattice architecture with robust session state management.

It combines:

- **Cryptographic grounding** (content-addressable truth)
- **Architectural intelligence** (multi-layer analysis)
- **Human values** (mission alignment)
- **Real-time synchronization** (watch/status/update)
- **Radical transparency** (audit trails + live TUI)
- **Security-first design** (dual-use awareness)
- **Extensible overlays** (7 cognitive dimensions)
- **Infinite context** (Sigma dual-lattice with intelligent compression)
- **Verifiable memory** (conversation indexed like code)

Rather than treating LLMs as magical oracles, it grounds them in verifiable fact, enabling a new generation of AI-powered developer tools that are trustworthy, auditable, and aligned with human values and principles.

## Meta-Development: The Dual-Claude Workflow

**Innovation #47-49** — A breakthrough in AI-assisted development validated during Nov 9, 2025 session.

### The Setup

Two Claude Sonnet 4.5 instances collaborating in real-time:

1. **Claude Code**: Full IDE access, implements and reviews code
2. **TUI Claude**: Terminal access, implements and reviews code

### The Workflow

```
┌─────────────────┐          ┌──────────────────┐
│  Claude Code    │◀───────▶│   TUI Claude     │
│                 │  Review  │     (Sigma)      │
│                 │  & Fix   │                  │
└─────────────────┘          └──────────────────┘
        │                            │
        │       Both Implement       │
        │       Both Review          │
        │       Both Fix             │
        ▼                            ▼
    Production-Ready Code
```

**Cycle Time:** ~30 minutes from feature → review → fixes → production

### Session Results (Nov 9, 2025)

| Commit  | Author      | Score | Issue Found                                       |
| ------- | ----------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| b9a792f | TUI Claude  | 9/10  | Fixed overlay alignment scores in Sigma Stats     |
| 707d4c0 | TUI Claude  | 10/10 | Found missed code path (query method)             |
| 0b6c359 | Claude Code | 6/10  | Initial GC Phase 5 (incomplete)                   |
| 98c75cd | Claude Code | 10/10 | Fixed all 3 issues from TUI review                |
| d4abe56 | TUI Claude  | 10/10 | Caught GC deleting doc objects (4/7 overlays bug) |

### Key Discoveries

**Issue 1: Overlay Alignment Scores**

- **Found by:** TUI Claude
- **Problem:** All overlays reading `alignment_O1` instead of overlay-specific scores
- **Impact:** Sigma Stats showed identical scores for all 7 overlays
- **Fix:** Dynamic overlay-specific score reading in 2 code paths

**Issue 2: GC Phase 5 Incomplete**

- **Found by:** TUI Claude
- **Problem:** Only cleaned 1/7 overlays, missed `symbolStructuralDataHash`
- **Impact:** Orphaned entries remained in 6 overlays
- **Fix:** Claude Code extended to all 7 overlays + both hash types

**Issue 3: GC Deleting Document Objects**

- **Found by:** User observation + TUI Claude analysis
- **Problem:** GC only checked 4/7 overlays for references
- **Impact:** Documents re-embedded on every wizard run
- **Fix:** Include all 7 overlays in reference check

### Performance

**Bloat Cleanup:**

- Sigma: 410 MB → 1.2 MB (99.7% reduction)
- 13,145 version files → 1 version file
- Historical delete+add pattern bloat eliminated

**Code Quality:**

- All commits: Linted, type-safe, built successfully
- Peer-reviewed by both Claude instances
- Production-ready on first deploy

### Human Role

The developer's involvement:

1. Approve agent actions when prompted
2. Provide high-level direction
3. Orchestrate the dual-Claude workflow
4. Monitor progress and results

### Implications

This validates a new development paradigm:

- **AI Pair Programming**: Two specialized AI agents collaborating
- **Real-time Review**: Immediate feedback and fixes
- **Zero Context Switching**: Both agents work simultaneously
- **Production Quality**: Peer-reviewed code on first attempt

**The future of development isn't human + AI. It's human orchestrating multiple specialized AIs.** 🚀

**The Sigma breakthrough** demonstrates that the same lattice architecture that provides verifiable understanding of codebases can provide verifiable memory for AI conversations — achieving true infinite context without the lossy compression and opacity of standard LLM wrappers.

The project represents a fundamental rethinking of how AI and humans can collaborate on software architecture — not through blind trust in statistical models, but through verifiable partnership rooted in cryptographic truth and mathematical lattice operations.
