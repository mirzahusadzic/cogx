- **Key Claims**:
  - Zero source file reading during analysis
  - 100% grounded in PGC metadata
  - Reproducible architectural insights
  - Demonstrated October 24, 2024 on cognition-cli itself

### 7. The .cogx File Format

- **Innovation**: Portable cognitive symbols
- **Key Claims**:
  - Complete project understanding in a single file
  - Cryptographic chain of trust
  - Import/export protocol for knowledge sharing

### 8. Cognitive Proof of Work (CPoW)

- **Innovation**: Monetizable verified intelligence
- **Key Claims**:
  - Verifiable intellectual labor via transform logs
  - Quality metrics (AQS, Fidelity Factors)
  - Decentralized knowledge marketplace

### 9. Event-Driven Coherence System

- **Innovation**: Real-time PGC synchronization
- **Key Claims**:
  - File watcher with dirty state management
  - Monument architecture (watch → status → update)
  - Context disturbance calculation (Δ)

### 10. Claude Code Integration Protocol

- **Innovation**: Grounded AI-assisted development
- **Key Claims**:
  - Slash command system for PGC interaction
  - Blast radius analysis before refactoring
  - Pre-commit coherence checking

## Validation

On October 24-25, 2025, the cognition-cli successfully performed meta-cognitive analysis on its own architecture in two validation tests:

1. **Reproducibility Test (Oct 24)**: Fresh Claude session analyzing 101 structural patterns with zero source file reading and 100% reproducibility
2. **Self-Sufficiency Test (Oct 25)**: Isolated environment with only `.open_cognition` PGC (no source files), proving complete architectural understanding from .cogx metadata alone

These demonstrations prove the viability of the disclosed innovations.
